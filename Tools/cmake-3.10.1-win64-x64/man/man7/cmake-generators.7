.SH INTRODUCTION
.sp
A \fICMake Generator\fP is responsible for writing the input files for
a native build system.  Exactly one of the \fI\%CMake Generators\fP must be
selected for a build tree to determine what native build system is to
be used.  Optionally one of the \fI\%Extra Generators\fP may be selected
as a variant of some of the \fI\%Command\-Line Build Tool Generators\fP to
produce project files for an auxiliary IDE.
.sp
CMake Generators are platform\-specific so each may be available only
on certain platforms.  The \fBcmake(1)\fP command\-line tool \fB\-\-help\fP
output lists available generators on the current platform.  Use its \fB\-G\fP
option to specify the generator for a new build tree.
The \fBcmake\-gui(1)\fP offers interactive selection of a generator
when creating a new build tree.
.SH CMAKE GENERATORS
.SS Command\-Line Build Tool Generators
.sp
These generators support command\-line build tools.  In order to use them,
one must launch CMake from a command\-line prompt whose environment is
already configured for the chosen compiler and build tool.
.SS Makefile Generators
.SS Borland Makefiles
.sp
Generates Borland makefiles.
.SS MSYS Makefiles
.sp
Generates makefiles for use with MSYS \fBmake\fP under the MSYS shell.
.sp
Use this generator in a MSYS shell prompt and using \fBmake\fP as the build
tool.  The generated makefiles use \fB/bin/sh\fP as the shell to launch build
rules.  They are not compatible with a Windows command prompt.
.sp
To build under a Windows command prompt, use the
\fBMinGW Makefiles\fP generator.
.SS MinGW Makefiles
.sp
Generates makefiles for use with \fBmingw32\-make\fP under a Windows command
prompt.
.sp
Use this generator under a Windows command prompt with MinGW in the \fBPATH\fP
and using \fBmingw32\-make\fP as the build tool.  The generated makefiles use
\fBcmd.exe\fP as the shell to launch build rules.  They are not compatible with
MSYS or a unix shell.
.sp
To build under the MSYS shell, use the \fBMSYS Makefiles\fP generator.
.SS NMake Makefiles
.sp
Generates NMake makefiles.
.SS NMake Makefiles JOM
.sp
Generates JOM makefiles.
.SS Unix Makefiles
.sp
Generates standard UNIX makefiles.
.sp
A hierarchy of UNIX makefiles is generated into the build tree.  Any
standard UNIX\-style make program can build the project through the
default make target.  A "make install" target is also provided.
.SS Watcom WMake
.sp
Generates Watcom WMake makefiles.
.SS Ninja Generator
.SS Ninja
.sp
Generates build.ninja files.
.sp
A build.ninja file is generated into the build tree.  Recent versions
of the ninja program can build the project through the "all" target.
An "install" target is also provided.
.sp
For each subdirectory \fBsub/dir\fP of the project, additional targets
are generated:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBsub/dir/all\fP
Depends on all targets required by the subdirectory.
.TP
.B \fBsub/dir/install\fP
Runs the install step in the subdirectory, if any.
.TP
.B \fBsub/dir/test\fP
Runs the test step in the subdirectory, if any.
.TP
.B \fBsub/dir/package\fP
Runs the package step in the subdirectory, if any.
.UNINDENT
.SS Fortran Support
.sp
The \fBNinja\fP generator conditionally supports Fortran when the \fBninja\fP
tool has the required features.  As of this version of CMake the needed
features have not been integrated into upstream Ninja.  Kitware maintains
a branch of Ninja with the required features on \fI\%github.com/Kitware/ninja\fP\&.
.SS IDE Build Tool Generators
.sp
These generators support Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
project files.  Since the IDEs configure their own environment
one may launch CMake from any environment.
.SS Visual Studio Generators
.SS Visual Studio 6
.sp
Removed.  This once generated Visual Studio 6 project files, but the
generator has been removed since CMake 3.6.  It is still possible to
build with VS 6 tools using the \fBNMake Makefiles\fP generator.
.SS Visual Studio 7
.sp
Removed.  This once generated Visual Studio .NET 2002 project files, but
the generator has been removed since CMake 3.6.  It is still possible to
build with VS 7.0 tools using the \fBNMake Makefiles\fP generator.
.SS Visual Studio 7 .NET 2003
.sp
Removed.  This once generated Visual Studio .NET 2003 project files, but
the generator has been removed since CMake 3.9.  It is still possible to
build with VS 7.1 tools using the \fBNMake Makefiles\fP generator.

using the \fBVisual Studio 10 2010\fP (or above) generator
with \fBCMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET\fP set to \fBv80\fP, or by
using the \fBNMake Makefiles\fP generator.

.SS Instance Selection
.sp
VS 2017 supports multiple installations on the same machine.
CMake queries the Visual Studio Installer to locate VS instances.

is chosen by default.  If the \fBVS150COMNTOOLS\fP environment variable
is set and points to the \fBCommon7/Tools\fP directory within one of
the instances, that instance will be used.  The environment variable
must remain consistently set whenever CMake is re\-run within a given
