.SH PROPERTIES OF GLOBAL SCOPE
.SS ALLOW_DUPLICATE_CUSTOM_TARGETS
.sp
Allow duplicate custom targets to be created.
.sp
Normally CMake requires that all targets built in a project have
globally unique logical names (see policy CMP0002).  This is necessary
to generate meaningful project file names in Xcode and VS IDE
generators.  It also allows the target names to be referenced
unambiguously.
.sp
Makefile generators are capable of supporting duplicate custom target
names.  For projects that care only about Makefile generators and do
not wish to support Xcode or VS IDE generators, one may set this
property to true to allow duplicate custom targets.  The property
allows multiple add_custom_target command calls in different
directories to specify the same target name.  However, setting this
property will cause non\-Makefile generators to produce an error and
refuse to generate the project.
.SS AUTOGEN_SOURCE_GROUP
.sp
Name of the  \fBsource_group()\fP for \fBAUTOMOC\fP and
\fBAUTORCC\fP generated files.
.sp
Files generated by \fBAUTOMOC\fP and \fBAUTORCC\fP are not always
known at configure time and therefore can\(aqt be passed to
\fBsource_group()\fP\&.
\fI\%AUTOGEN_SOURCE_GROUP\fP an be used instead to generate or select
a source group for \fBAUTOMOC\fP and \fBAUTORCC\fP generated files.
.sp
For \fBAUTOMOC\fP and \fBAUTORCC\fP specific overrides see
\fBAUTOMOC_SOURCE_GROUP\fP and \fBAUTORCC_SOURCE_GROUP\fP
respectively.
.SS AUTOGEN_TARGETS_FOLDER
.sp
Name of \fBFOLDER\fP for \fB*_autogen\fP targets that are added
automatically by CMake for targets for which \fBAUTOMOC\fP is enabled.
.sp
If not set, CMake uses the \fBFOLDER\fP property of the parent target as a
default value for this property.  See also the documentation for the
\fBFOLDER\fP target property and the \fBAUTOMOC\fP target property.
.SS AUTOMOC_SOURCE_GROUP
.sp
Name of the  \fBsource_group()\fP for \fBAUTOMOC\fP generated files.
.sp
When set this is used instead of \fBAUTOGEN_SOURCE_GROUP\fP for
files generated by \fBAUTOMOC\fP\&.
.SS AUTOMOC_TARGETS_FOLDER
.sp
Name of \fBFOLDER\fP for \fB*_autogen\fP targets that are added automatically by
CMake for targets for which \fBAUTOMOC\fP is enabled.
.sp
This property is obsolete.  Use \fBAUTOGEN_TARGETS_FOLDER\fP instead.
.sp
If not set, CMake uses the \fBFOLDER\fP property of the parent target as a
default value for this property.  See also the documentation for the
\fBFOLDER\fP target property and the \fBAUTOMOC\fP target property.
.SS AUTORCC_SOURCE_GROUP
.sp
Name of the  \fBsource_group()\fP for \fBAUTORCC\fP generated files.
.sp
When set this is used instead of \fBAUTOGEN_SOURCE_GROUP\fP for
files generated by \fBAUTORCC\fP\&.
.SS CMAKE_C_KNOWN_FEATURES

.UNINDENT
.SS DEBUG_CONFIGURATIONS
.sp
Specify which configurations are for debugging.
.sp
The value must be a semi\-colon separated list of configuration names.
Currently this property is used only by the target_link_libraries
command (see its documentation for details).  Additional uses may be
defined in the future.
.sp
This property must be set at the top level of the project and before
the first target_link_libraries command invocation.  If any entry in
the list does not match a valid configuration for the project the
behavior is undefined.
.SS DISABLED_FEATURES
.sp
List of features which are disabled during the CMake run.
.sp
List of features which are disabled during the CMake run.  By default
it contains the names of all packages which were not found.  This is

property is set to true on OpenBSD and false on other platforms.
.SS GENERATOR_IS_MULTI_CONFIG
.sp
Read\-only property that is true on multi\-configuration generators.
.sp
True when using a multi\-configuration generator
(such as Visual Studio Generators or \fBXcode\fP).
Multi\-config generators use \fBCMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES\fP
as the set of configurations and ignore \fBCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE\fP\&.
.SS GLOBAL_DEPENDS_DEBUG_MODE
.sp
Enable global target dependency graph debug mode.
.sp
CMake automatically analyzes the global inter\-target dependency graph
at the beginning of native build system generation.  This property
causes it to display details of its analysis to stderr.
.SS GLOBAL_DEPENDS_NO_CYCLES
.sp
Disallow global target dependency graph cycles.
.sp
CMake automatically analyzes the global inter\-target dependency graph
at the beginning of native build system generation.  It reports an
error if the dependency graph contains a cycle that does not consist

of concurrent jobs which can be started by a rule assigned to the pool.
The \fI\%JOB_POOLS\fP property is a semicolon\-separated list of
pairs using the syntax NAME=integer (without a space after the equality sign).
.sp
For instance:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
set_property(GLOBAL PROPERTY JOB_POOLS two_jobs=2 ten_jobs=10)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Defined pools could be used globally by setting
\fBCMAKE_JOB_POOL_COMPILE\fP and \fBCMAKE_JOB_POOL_LINK\fP
or per target by setting the target properties
\fBJOB_POOL_COMPILE\fP and \fBJOB_POOL_LINK\fP\&.
.sp
Build targets provided by CMake that are meant for individual interactive
use, such as \fBinstall\fP, are placed in the \fBconsole\fP pool automatically.
.SS PREDEFINED_TARGETS_FOLDER
.sp
Name of FOLDER for targets that are added automatically by CMake.
.sp
If not set, CMake uses "CMakePredefinedTargets" as a default value for
this property.  Targets such as INSTALL, PACKAGE and RUN_TESTS will be
organized into this FOLDER.  See also the documentation for the
\fBFOLDER\fP target property.
.SS ECLIPSE_EXTRA_NATURES
.sp
List of natures to add to the generated Eclipse project file.
.sp
Eclipse projects specify language plugins by using natures. This property
should be set to the unique identifier for a nature (which looks like a Java
package name).
.SS REPORT_UNDEFINED_PROPERTIES
.sp
If set, report any undefined properties to this file.
.sp
If this property is set to a filename then when CMake runs it will
report any properties or variables that were accessed but not defined
into the filename specified in this property.
.SS RULE_LAUNCH_COMPILE
.sp
Specify a launcher for compile rules.
.sp
Makefile Generators and the \fBNinja\fP generator prefix
compiler commands with the given launcher command line.
This is intended to allow launchers to intercept build problems
with high granularity.  Other generators ignore this property
because their underlying build systems provide no hook to wrap
individual commands with a launcher.
.SS RULE_LAUNCH_CUSTOM
.sp
Specify a launcher for custom rules.
.sp
Makefile Generators and the \fBNinja\fP generator prefix
custom commands with the given launcher command line.
This is intended to allow launchers to intercept build problems
with high granularity.  Other generators ignore this property
because their underlying build systems provide no hook to wrap
individual commands with a launcher.
.SS RULE_LAUNCH_LINK
.sp
Specify a launcher for link rules.
.sp
Makefile Generators and the \fBNinja\fP generator prefix
link and archive commands with the given launcher command line.
This is intended to allow launchers to intercept build problems
with high granularity.  Other generators ignore this property
because their underlying build systems provide no hook to wrap
individual commands with a launcher.
.SS RULE_MESSAGES
.sp
Specify whether to report a message for each make rule.
.sp
This property specifies whether Makefile generators should add a
progress message describing what each build rule does.  If the
property is not set the default is ON.  Set the property to OFF to
disable granular messages and report only as each target completes.
This is intended to allow scripted builds to avoid the build time cost
of detailed reports.  If a \fBCMAKE_RULE_MESSAGES\fP cache entry exists
its value initializes the value of this property.  Non\-Makefile
generators currently ignore this property.
.SS TARGET_ARCHIVES_MAY_BE_SHARED_LIBS
.sp
Set if shared libraries may be named like archives.
.sp
On AIX shared libraries may be named "lib<name>.a".  This property is
set to true on such platforms.
.SS TARGET_MESSAGES
.sp
Specify whether to report the completion of each target.
.sp
This property specifies whether Makefile Generators should
add a progress message describing that each target has been completed.
If the property is not set the default is \fBON\fP\&.  Set the property
to \fBOFF\fP to disable target completion messages.
.sp
This option is intended to reduce build output when little or no
work needs to be done to bring the build tree up to date.
.sp
If a \fBCMAKE_TARGET_MESSAGES\fP cache entry exists its value
initializes the value of this property.
.sp
Non\-Makefile generators currently ignore this property.
.sp
See the counterpart property \fBRULE_MESSAGES\fP to disable
everything except for target completion messages.
.SS TARGET_SUPPORTS_SHARED_LIBS
.sp
Does the target platform support shared libraries.
.sp
TARGET_SUPPORTS_SHARED_LIBS is a boolean specifying whether the target
platform supports shared libraries.  Basically all current general
general purpose OS do so, the exception are usually embedded systems
with no or special OSs.
.SS USE_FOLDERS
.sp
Use the \fBFOLDER\fP target property to organize targets into
folders.
.sp
If not set, CMake treats this property as OFF by default.  CMake
generators that are capable of organizing into a hierarchy of folders
use the values of the \fBFOLDER\fP target property to name those
folders. See also the documentation for the FOLDER target property.
.SS XCODE_EMIT_EFFECTIVE_PLATFORM_NAME
.sp
Control emission of \fBEFFECTIVE_PLATFORM_NAME\fP by the Xcode generator.
.sp
It is required for building the same target with multiple SDKs. A
common use case is the parallel use of \fBiphoneos\fP and
\fBiphonesimulator\fP SDKs.
.sp
Three different states possible that control when the Xcode generator
emits the \fBEFFECTIVE_PLATFORM_NAME\fP variable:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
If set to \fBON\fP it will always be emitted
.IP \(bu 2
If set to \fBOFF\fP it will never be emitted
.IP \(bu 2
If unset (the default) it will only be emitted when the project was
configured for an embedded Xcode SDK like iOS, tvOS, watchOS or any
of the simulators.
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
When this behavior is enable for generated Xcode projects, the
\fBEFFECTIVE_PLATFORM_NAME\fP variable will leak into
\fBGenerator expressions\fP
like \fBTARGET_FILE\fP and will render those mostly unusable.

.sp
This read\-only directory property contains a
;\-list of buildsystem targets added in the
directory by calls to the \fBadd_library()\fP, \fBadd_executable()\fP,
and \fBadd_custom_target()\fP commands.  The list does not include any
Imported Targets or Alias Targets, but does include
Interface Libraries\&.  Each entry in the list is the logical name
of a target, suitable to pass to the \fBget_property()\fP command
\fBTARGET\fP option.
.SS CACHE_VARIABLES
.sp
List of cache variables available in the current directory.
.sp
This read\-only property specifies the list of CMake cache variables
currently defined.  It is intended for debugging purposes.
.SS CLEAN_NO_CUSTOM
.sp
Set to true to tell Makefile Generators not to remove the outputs of
custom commands for this directory during the \fBmake clean\fP operation.
This is ignored on other generators because it is not possible to implement.
.SS CMAKE_CONFIGURE_DEPENDS
.sp
Tell CMake about additional input files to the configuration process.
If any named file is modified the build system will re\-run CMake to
re\-configure the file and generate the build system again.
.sp
Specify files as a semicolon\-separated list of paths.  Relative paths
are interpreted as relative to the current source directory.
.SS COMPILE_DEFINITIONS
.sp
Preprocessor definitions for compiling a directory\(aqs sources.
.sp
This property specifies the list of options given so far to the
\fBadd_definitions()\fP command.
.sp
The \fBCOMPILE_DEFINITIONS\fP property may be set to a semicolon\-separated
list of preprocessor definitions using the syntax \fBVAR\fP or \fBVAR=value\fP\&.
Function\-style definitions are not supported.  CMake will
automatically escape the value correctly for the native build system
(note that CMake language syntax may require escapes to specify some
values).
.sp
This property will be initialized in each directory by its value in the

.sp
CMake will automatically drop some definitions that are not supported
by the native build tool.
.sp
Disclaimer: Most native build tools have poor support for escaping
certain values.  CMake has work\-arounds for many cases but some values
may just not be possible to pass correctly.  If a value does not seem
to be escaped correctly, do not attempt to work\-around the problem by
adding escape sequences to the value.  Your work\-around may break in a
future version of CMake that has improved escape support.  Instead
consider defining the macro in a (configured) header file.  Then
report the limitation.  Known limitations include:

Contents of \fBCOMPILE_DEFINITIONS\fP may use "generator expressions" with
the syntax \fB$<...>\fP\&.  See the \fBcmake\-generator\-expressions(7)\fP
manual for available expressions.  See the \fBcmake\-buildsystem(7)\fP
manual for more on defining buildsystem properties.
.sp
The corresponding \fBCOMPILE_DEFINITIONS_<CONFIG>\fP property may
be set to specify per\-configuration definitions.  Generator expressions
should be preferred instead of setting the alternative property.
.SS COMPILE_OPTIONS
.sp
List of options to pass to the compiler.
.sp
This property holds a ;\-list of options
given so far to the \fBadd_compile_options()\fP command.
.sp
This property is used to initialize the \fBCOMPILE_OPTIONS\fP target
property when a target is created, which is used by the generators to set
the options for the compiler.
.sp
Contents of \fBCOMPILE_OPTIONS\fP may use "generator expressions" with the
syntax \fB$<...>\fP\&.  See the \fBcmake\-generator\-expressions(7)\fP manual
for available expressions.  See the \fBcmake\-buildsystem(7)\fP manual
for more on defining buildsystem properties.
.SS DEFINITIONS
.sp
For CMake 2.4 compatibility only.  Use \fBCOMPILE_DEFINITIONS\fP
instead.
.sp
This read\-only property specifies the list of flags given so far to
the \fBadd_definitions()\fP command.  It is intended for debugging
purposes.  Use the \fBCOMPILE_DEFINITIONS\fP directory property
instead.
.sp
This built\-in read\-only property does not exist if policy
\fBCMP0059\fP is set to \fBNEW\fP\&.
.SS EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL
.sp
Exclude the directory from the all target of its parent.
.sp
A property on a directory that indicates if its targets are excluded
from the default build target.  If it is not, then with a Makefile for
example typing make will cause the targets to be built.  The same
concept applies to the default build of other generators.
.SS IMPLICIT_DEPENDS_INCLUDE_TRANSFORM
.sp
Specify #include line transforms for dependencies in a directory.
.sp
This property specifies rules to transform macro\-like #include lines
during implicit dependency scanning of C and C++ source files.  The
list of rules must be semicolon\-separated with each entry of the form
"A_MACRO(%)=value\-with\-%" (the % must be literal).  During dependency
scanning occurrences of A_MACRO(...) on #include lines will be
replaced by the value given with the macro argument substituted for
\(aq%\(aq.  For example, the entry

.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf

.sp
This property applies to sources in all targets within a directory.
The property value is initialized in each directory by its value in
the directory\(aqs parent.
.SS INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES
.sp
List of preprocessor include file search directories.
.sp
This property specifies the list of directories given so far to the
\fBinclude_directories()\fP command.
.sp
This property is used to populate the \fBINCLUDE_DIRECTORIES\fP
target property, which is used by the generators to set the include
directories for the compiler.
.sp
In addition to accepting values from that command, values may be set
directly on any directory using the \fBset_property()\fP command.  A
directory gets its initial value from its parent directory if it has one.
The initial value of the \fBINCLUDE_DIRECTORIES\fP target property
comes from the value of this property.  Both directory and target property
values are adjusted by calls to the \fBinclude_directories()\fP command.
.sp
The target property values are used by the generators to set the
include paths for the compiler.
.sp
Contents of \fBINCLUDE_DIRECTORIES\fP may use "generator expressions" with
the syntax \fB$<...>\fP\&.  See the \fBcmake\-generator\-expressions(7)\fP
manual for available expressions.  See the \fBcmake\-buildsystem(7)\fP
manual for more on defining buildsystem properties.
.SS INCLUDE_REGULAR_EXPRESSION
.sp
Include file scanning regular expression.
.sp
This property specifies the regular expression used during
dependency scanning to match include files that should be followed.
See the \fBinclude_regular_expression()\fP command for a high\-level
interface to set this property.
.SS INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION_<CONFIG>
.sp

.sp
This is a per\-configuration version of INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION.
If set, this property overrides the generic property for the named
configuration.
.SS INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION
.sp
Enable interprocedural optimization for targets in a directory.
.sp
If set to true, enables interprocedural optimizations if they are
known to be supported by the compiler.
.SS LABELS
.sp
Specify a list of text labels associated with a directory and all of its
subdirectories. This is equivalent to setting the \fBLABELS\fP target
property and the \fBLABELS\fP test property on all targets and tests in
the current directory and subdirectories. Note: Launchers must enabled to
propagate labels to targets.
.sp
The \fBCMAKE_DIRECTORY_LABELS\fP variable can be used to initialize this
property.
.sp
The list is reported in dashboard submissions.
.SS LINK_DIRECTORIES
.sp
List of linker search directories.
.sp
This read\-only property specifies the list of directories given so far
to the link_directories command.  It is intended for debugging
purposes.
.SS LISTFILE_STACK
.sp
The current stack of listfiles being processed.
.sp
This property is mainly useful when trying to debug errors in your
CMake scripts.  It returns a list of what list files are currently
being processed, in order.  So if one listfile does an
\fBinclude()\fP command then that is effectively pushing the
included listfile onto the stack.
.SS MACROS
.sp
List of macro commands available in the current directory.
.sp
This read\-only property specifies the list of CMake macros currently
defined.  It is intended for debugging purposes.  See the macro
command.
.SS PARENT_DIRECTORY
.sp
Source directory that added current subdirectory.
.sp
This read\-only property specifies the source directory that added the
current source directory as a subdirectory of the build.  In the
top\-level directory the value is the empty\-string.

Specify a launcher for compile rules.
.sp
See the global property of the same name for details.  This overrides
the global property for a directory.
.SS RULE_LAUNCH_CUSTOM
.sp
Specify a launcher for custom rules.
.sp
See the global property of the same name for details.  This overrides
the global property for a directory.
.SS RULE_LAUNCH_LINK
.sp
Specify a launcher for link rules.
.sp
See the global property of the same name for details.  This overrides
the global property for a directory.
.SS SOURCE_DIR
.sp
This read\-only directory property reports absolute path to the source
directory on which it is read.
.SS SUBDIRECTORIES
.sp
This read\-only directory property contains a
;\-list of subdirectories processed so far by
the \fBadd_subdirectory()\fP or \fBsubdirs()\fP commands.  Each entry is
the absolute path to the source directory (containing the \fBCMakeLists.txt\fP
file).  This is suitable to pass to the \fBget_property()\fP command
\fBDIRECTORY\fP option.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The \fBsubdirs()\fP command does not process its arguments until
after the calling directory is fully processed.  Therefore looking
up this property in the current directory will not see them.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS TEST_INCLUDE_FILES
.sp
A list of cmake files that will be included when ctest is run.
.sp
If you specify \fBTEST_INCLUDE_FILES\fP, those files will be included and
processed when ctest is run on the directory.
.SS VARIABLES
.sp
List of variables defined in the current directory.
.sp
This read\-only property specifies the list of CMake variables
currently defined.  It is intended for debugging purposes.
.SS VS_GLOBAL_SECTION_POST_<section>
.sp
Specify a postSolution global section in Visual Studio.
.sp
Setting a property like this generates an entry of the following form
in the solution file:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
GlobalSection(<section>) = postSolution
  <contents based on property value>
EndGlobalSection
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The property must be set to a semicolon\-separated list of key=value
pairs.  Each such pair will be transformed into an entry in the
solution global section.  Whitespace around key and value is ignored.
List elements which do not contain an equal sign are skipped.
.sp
This property only works for Visual Studio 8 and above; it is ignored
on other generators.  The property only applies when set on a
directory whose CMakeLists.txt contains a project() command.
.sp
Note that CMake generates postSolution sections ExtensibilityGlobals
and ExtensibilityAddIns by default.  If you set the corresponding
property, it will override the default section.  For example, setting
VS_GLOBAL_SECTION_POST_ExtensibilityGlobals will override the default
contents of the ExtensibilityGlobals section, while keeping
ExtensibilityAddIns on its default.  However, CMake will always
add a \fBSolutionGuid\fP to the \fBExtensibilityGlobals\fP section
if it is not specified explicitly.
.SS VS_GLOBAL_SECTION_PRE_<section>
.sp
Specify a preSolution global section in Visual Studio.
.sp
Setting a property like this generates an entry of the following form
in the solution file:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
GlobalSection(<section>) = preSolution
  <contents based on property value>

solution global section.  Whitespace around key and value is ignored.
List elements which do not contain an equal sign are skipped.
.sp
This property only works for Visual Studio 8 and above; it is ignored
on other generators.  The property only applies when set on a
directory whose CMakeLists.txt contains a project() command.
.SS VS_STARTUP_PROJECT
.sp
Specify the default startup project in a Visual Studio solution.
.sp
The Visual Studio Generators create a \fB\&.sln\fP file for each directory
whose \fBCMakeLists.txt\fP file calls the \fBproject()\fP command.  Set this
property in the same directory as a \fBproject()\fP command call (e.g. in
the top\-level \fBCMakeLists.txt\fP file) to specify the default startup project
for the correpsonding solution file.
.sp
The property must be set to the name of an existing target.  This
will cause that project to be listed first in the generated solution
file causing Visual Studio to make it the startup project if the
solution has never been opened before.
.sp
If this property is not specified, then the \fBALL_BUILD\fP project
will be the default.
.SH PROPERTIES ON TARGETS
.SS ALIASED_TARGET

.SS ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_<CONFIG>
.sp
Per\-configuration output directory for
ARCHIVE target files.
.sp
This is a per\-configuration version of the
\fBARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY\fP target property, but
multi\-configuration generators (VS, Xcode) do NOT append a
per\-configuration subdirectory to the specified directory.  This
property is initialized by the value of the
\fBCMAKE_ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_<CONFIG>\fP variable if
it is set when a target is created.
.sp
Contents of \fBARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_<CONFIG>\fP may use
\fBgenerator expressions\fP\&.
.SS ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
.sp
Output directory in which to build ARCHIVE target files.
.sp
This property specifies the directory into which archive target files
should be built.  The property value may use
\fBgenerator expressions\fP\&.
Multi\-configuration generators (VS, Xcode) append a per\-configuration
subdirectory to the specified directory unless a generator expression

.sp
See also the \fBARCHIVE_OUTPUT_NAME_<CONFIG>\fP target property.
.SS AUTOGEN_BUILD_DIR
.sp
Directory where \fBAUTOMOC\fP, \fBAUTOUIC\fP and \fBAUTORCC\fP
generate files for the target.
.sp
The directory is created on demand and automatically added to the
\fBADDITIONAL_MAKE_CLEAN_FILES\fP\&.
.sp
When unset or empty the directory \fB<dir>/<target\-name>_autogen\fP is used where
\fB<dir>\fP is \fBCMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR\fP and \fB<target\-name>\fP
is \fBNAME\fP\&.
.sp
By default \fI\%AUTOGEN_BUILD_DIR\fP is unset.
.sp
See the \fBcmake\-qt(7)\fP manual for more information on using CMake
with Qt.
.SS AUTOGEN_TARGET_DEPENDS
.sp
Target dependencies of the corresponding \fB_autogen\fP target.
.sp
Targets which have their \fBAUTOMOC\fP target \fBON\fP have a
corresponding \fB_autogen\fP target which is used to autogenerate generate moc
files.  As this \fB_autogen\fP target is created at generate\-time, it is not
possible to define dependencies of it, such as to create inputs for the \fBmoc\fP
executable.
.sp
The \fBAUTOGEN_TARGET_DEPENDS\fP target property can be set instead to a list of
dependencies for the \fB_autogen\fP target.  The buildsystem will be generated to
depend on its contents.
.sp
See the \fBcmake\-qt(7)\fP manual for more information on using CMake
with Qt.
.SS AUTOMOC_COMPILER_PREDEFINES
.sp
Boolean value used by \fBAUTOMOC\fP to determine if the
compiler pre definitions file \fBmoc_predefs.h\fP should be generated.
.sp
CMake generates a \fBmoc_predefs.h\fP file with compiler pre definitions
from the output of the command defined in
\fBCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_PREDEFINES_COMMAND\fP
when
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBAUTOMOC\fP is enabled,
.IP \(bu 2
\fI\%AUTOMOC_COMPILER_PREDEFINES\fP is enabled,
.IP \(bu 2
\fBCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_PREDEFINES_COMMAND\fP isn\(aqt empty and
.IP \(bu 2
the Qt version is greater or equal 5.8.
.UNINDENT
.sp
The \fBmoc_predefs.h\fP file, which is generated in \fBAUTOGEN_BUILD_DIR\fP,
is passed to \fBmoc\fP as the argument to the \fB\-\-include\fP option.
.sp
By default \fI\%AUTOMOC_COMPILER_PREDEFINES\fP is initialized from
\fBCMAKE_AUTOMOC_COMPILER_PREDEFINES\fP, which is ON by default.
.sp
See the \fBcmake\-qt(7)\fP manual for more information on using CMake
with Qt.
.SS AUTOMOC_DEPEND_FILTERS
.sp
Filter definitions used by \fBAUTOMOC\fP to extract file names from
source code as additional dependencies for the \fBmoc\fP file.
.sp
This property is only used if the \fBAUTOMOC\fP property is \fBON\fP
for this target.
.sp
Filters are defined as \fBKEYWORD;REGULAR_EXPRESSION\fP pairs. First the file
content is searched for \fBKEYWORD\fP\&. If it is found at least once, then file
names are extracted by successively searching for \fBREGULAR_EXPRESSION\fP and
taking the first match group.
.sp
Consider a filter extracts the file name \fBDEP\fP from the content of a file
\fBFOO\fP\&. If \fBDEP\fP changes, then the \fBmoc\fP file for \fBFOO\fP gets rebuilt.
The file \fBDEP\fP is searched for first in the vicinity
of \fBFOO\fP and afterwards in the target\(aqs \fBINCLUDE_DIRECTORIES\fP\&.
.sp
By default \fI\%AUTOMOC_DEPEND_FILTERS\fP is initialized from
\fBCMAKE_AUTOMOC_DEPEND_FILTERS\fP, which is empty by default.
.sp
See the \fBcmake\-qt(7)\fP manual for more information on using CMake
with Qt.
.SS Example
.sp
Consider a file \fBFOO.hpp\fP holds a custom macro \fBOBJ_JSON_FILE\fP and we
want the \fBmoc\fP file to depend on the macro\(gas file name argument:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp

.SS AUTOMOC_MACRO_NAMES
.sp
A ;\-list list of macro names used by
\fBAUTOMOC\fP to determine if a C++ file needs to be processed by \fBmoc\fP\&.
.sp
This property is only used if the \fBAUTOMOC\fP property is \fBON\fP
for this target.
.sp
When running \fBAUTOMOC\fP, CMake searches for the strings listed in
\fI\%AUTOMOC_MACRO_NAMES\fP in C++ source and header files.
If any of the strings is found
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
as the first non space string on a new line or
.IP \(bu 2
as the first non space string after a \fB{\fP on a new line,
.UNINDENT
.sp
then the file will be processed by \fBmoc\fP\&.
.sp
By default \fI\%AUTOMOC_MACRO_NAMES\fP is initialized from
\fBCMAKE_AUTOMOC_MACRO_NAMES\fP\&.
.sp
See the \fBcmake\-qt(7)\fP manual for more information on using CMake
with Qt.
.SS Example
.sp
In this case the the \fBQ_OBJECT\fP macro is hidden inside an other macro

Additional options for moc when using \fBAUTOMOC\fP
.sp
This property is only used if the \fBAUTOMOC\fP property is \fBON\fP
for this target.  In this case, it holds additional command line
options which will be used when \fBmoc\fP is executed during the build, i.e.
it is equivalent to the optional \fBOPTIONS\fP argument of the
\fBqt4_wrap_cpp()\fP macro.
.sp
By default it is empty.
.sp
See the \fBcmake\-qt(7)\fP manual for more information on using CMake

.SS AUTOMOC
.sp
Should the target be processed with automoc (for Qt projects).
.sp
AUTOMOC is a boolean specifying whether CMake will handle the Qt \fBmoc\fP
preprocessor automatically, i.e.  without having to use the
\fBQT4_WRAP_CPP()\fP or QT5_WRAP_CPP() macro.
Currently Qt4 and Qt5 are supported.
.sp
When this property is set \fBON\fP, CMake will scan the header and
source files at build time and invoke moc accordingly.

.SS BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH
.sp
\fBBUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH\fP is a boolean specifying whether to link the target

.sp
If policy \fBCMP0068\fP is not \fBNEW\fP, this property also controls use of

This target is a \fBCFBundle\fP on the OS X.
.sp
If a module library target has this property set to true it will be
built as a \fBCFBundle\fP when built on the mac.  It will have the directory
structure required for a \fBCFBundle\fP and will be suitable to be used for
creating Browser Plugins or other application resources.
.SS C_EXTENSIONS
.sp
Boolean specifying whether compiler specific extensions are requested.
.sp
This property specifies whether compiler specific extensions should be
used.  For some compilers, this results in adding a flag such
as \fB\-std=gnu11\fP instead of \fB\-std=c11\fP to the compile line.  This
property is \fBON\fP by default. The basic C standard level is
controlled by the \fBC_STANDARD\fP target property.
.sp
See the \fBcmake\-compile\-features(7)\fP manual for information on
compile features and a list of supported compilers.
.sp
This property is initialized by the value of
the \fBCMAKE_C_EXTENSIONS\fP variable if it is set when a target
is created.
.SS C_STANDARD
.sp
The C standard whose features are requested to build this target.
.sp
This property specifies the C standard whose features are requested
to build this target.  For some compilers, this results in adding a
flag such as \fB\-std=gnu11\fP to the compile line.  For compilers that
have no notion of a standard level, such as Microsoft Visual C++ before
2015 Update 3, this has no effect.
.sp
Supported values are \fB90\fP, \fB99\fP and \fB11\fP\&.

be controlled with the \fBC_STANDARD_REQUIRED\fP target property.
Additionally, the \fBC_EXTENSIONS\fP target property may be used to
control whether compiler\-specific extensions are enabled on a per\-target basis.
.sp
See the \fBcmake\-compile\-features(7)\fP manual for information on

.SS C_STANDARD_REQUIRED
.sp
Boolean describing whether the value of \fBC_STANDARD\fP is a requirement.
.sp
If this property is set to \fBON\fP, then the value of the
\fBC_STANDARD\fP target property is treated as a requirement.  If this
property is \fBOFF\fP or unset, the \fBC_STANDARD\fP target property is
treated as optional and may "decay" to a previous standard if the requested is
not available.  For compilers that have no notion of a standard level, such as
MSVC, this has no effect.
.sp
See the \fBcmake\-compile\-features(7)\fP manual for information on

.SS COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_BOOL
.sp
Properties which must be compatible with their link interface
.sp
The \fBCOMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_BOOL\fP property may contain a list of
properties for this target which must be consistent when evaluated as a
boolean with the \fBINTERFACE\fP variant of the property in all linked
dependees.  For example, if a property \fBFOO\fP appears in the list, then
for each dependee, the \fBINTERFACE_FOO\fP property content in all of its
dependencies must be consistent with each other, and with the \fBFOO\fP
property in the depender.
.sp
Consistency in this sense has the meaning that if the property is set,
then it must have the same boolean value as all others, and if the
property is not set, then it is ignored.
.sp
Note that for each dependee, the set of properties specified in this
property must not intersect with the set specified in any of the other
Compatible Interface Properties\&.
.SS COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_NUMBER_MAX
.sp
Properties whose maximum value from the link interface will be used.
.sp
The \fBCOMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_NUMBER_MAX\fP property may contain a list of
properties for this target whose maximum value may be read at generate
time when evaluated in the \fBINTERFACE\fP variant of the property in all
linked dependees.  For example, if a property \fBFOO\fP appears in the list,
then for each dependee, the \fBINTERFACE_FOO\fP property content in all of
its dependencies will be compared with each other and with the \fBFOO\fP
property in the depender.  When reading the \fBFOO\fP property at generate
time, the maximum value will be returned. If the property is not set,
then it is ignored.
.sp
Note that for each dependee, the set of properties specified in this
property must not intersect with the set specified in any of the other
Compatible Interface Properties\&.
.SS COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_NUMBER_MIN
.sp
Properties whose maximum value from the link interface will be used.
.sp
The \fBCOMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_NUMBER_MIN\fP property may contain a list of
properties for this target whose minimum value may be read at generate
time when evaluated in the \fBINTERFACE\fP variant of the property of all
linked dependees.  For example, if a
property \fBFOO\fP appears in the list, then for each dependee, the
\fBINTERFACE_FOO\fP property content in all of its dependencies will be
compared with each other and with the \fBFOO\fP property in the depender.
When reading the \fBFOO\fP property at generate time, the minimum value
will be returned.  If the property is not set, then it is ignored.
.sp
Note that for each dependee, the set of properties specified in this
property must not intersect with the set specified in any of the other
Compatible Interface Properties\&.
.SS COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_STRING
.sp
Properties which must be string\-compatible with their link interface
.sp
The \fBCOMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_STRING\fP property may contain a list of
properties for this target which must be the same when evaluated as a
string in the \fBINTERFACE\fP variant of the property all linked dependees.
For example, if a property \fBFOO\fP appears in the list, then for each
dependee, the \fBINTERFACE_FOO\fP property content in all of its
dependencies must be equal with each other, and with the \fBFOO\fP property
in the depender.  If the property is not set, then it is ignored.
.sp
Note that for each dependee, the set of properties specified in this
property must not intersect with the set specified in any of the other
Compatible Interface Properties\&.
.SS COMPILE_DEFINITIONS
.sp
Preprocessor definitions for compiling a target\(aqs sources.
.sp
The \fBCOMPILE_DEFINITIONS\fP property may be set to a semicolon\-separated
list of preprocessor definitions using the syntax \fBVAR\fP or \fBVAR=value\fP\&.
Function\-style definitions are not supported.  CMake will
automatically escape the value correctly for the native build system
(note that CMake language syntax may require escapes to specify some
values).
.sp
CMake will automatically drop some definitions that are not supported
by the native build tool.
.sp
Disclaimer: Most native build tools have poor support for escaping
certain values.  CMake has work\-arounds for many cases but some values
may just not be possible to pass correctly.  If a value does not seem
to be escaped correctly, do not attempt to work\-around the problem by
adding escape sequences to the value.  Your work\-around may break in a
future version of CMake that has improved escape support.  Instead
consider defining the macro in a (configured) header file.  Then
report the limitation.  Known limitations include:

.SS CUDA_EXTENSIONS
.sp
Boolean specifying whether compiler specific extensions are requested.
.sp
This property specifies whether compiler specific extensions should be
used.  For some compilers, this results in adding a flag such
as \fB\-std=gnu++11\fP instead of \fB\-std=c++11\fP to the compile line.  This
property is \fBON\fP by default. The basic CUDA/C++ standard level is
controlled by the \fBCUDA_STANDARD\fP target property.
.sp
See the \fBcmake\-compile\-features(7)\fP manual for information on
compile features and a list of supported compilers.
.sp
This property is initialized by the value of
the \fBCMAKE_CUDA_EXTENSIONS\fP variable if it is set when a target
is created.
.SS CUDA_STANDARD
.sp
The CUDA/C++ standard whose features are requested to build this target.
.sp
This property specifies the CUDA/C++ standard whose features are requested
to build this target.  For some compilers, this results in adding a
flag such as \fB\-std=gnu++11\fP to the compile line.
.sp
Supported values are \fB98\fP, \fB11\fP, \fB14\fP\&.

.SS CUDA_STANDARD_REQUIRED
.sp
Boolean describing whether the value of \fBCUDA_STANDARD\fP is a requirement.
.sp
If this property is set to \fBON\fP, then the value of the
\fBCUDA_STANDARD\fP target property is treated as a requirement.  If this
property is \fBOFF\fP or unset, the \fBCUDA_STANDARD\fP target property is
treated as optional and may "decay" to a previous standard if the requested is
not available.  For compilers that have no notion of a standard level, such as
MSVC, this has no effect.

.SS CXX_EXTENSIONS
.sp
Boolean specifying whether compiler specific extensions are requested.
.sp
This property specifies whether compiler specific extensions should be
used.  For some compilers, this results in adding a flag such
as \fB\-std=gnu++11\fP instead of \fB\-std=c++11\fP to the compile line.  This
property is \fBON\fP by default. The basic C++ standard level is

.SS CXX_STANDARD
.sp
The C++ standard whose features are requested to build this target.
.sp
This property specifies the C++ standard whose features are requested
to build this target.  For some compilers, this results in adding a
flag such as \fB\-std=gnu++11\fP to the compile line.  For compilers that
have no notion of a standard level, such as Microsoft Visual C++ before
2015 Update 3, this has no effect.
.sp
Supported values are \fB98\fP, \fB11\fP, \fB14\fP, and \fB17\fP\&.

.SS CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED
.sp
Boolean describing whether the value of \fBCXX_STANDARD\fP is a requirement.
.sp
If this property is set to \fBON\fP, then the value of the
\fBCXX_STANDARD\fP target property is treated as a requirement.  If this
property is \fBOFF\fP or unset, the \fBCXX_STANDARD\fP target property is

.SS DEBUG_POSTFIX
.sp
See target property <CONFIG>_POSTFIX.
.sp
This property is a special case of the more\-general <CONFIG>_POSTFIX
property for the DEBUG configuration.
.SS DEFINE_SYMBOL
.sp
Define a symbol when compiling this target\(aqs sources.
.sp
DEFINE_SYMBOL sets the name of the preprocessor symbol defined when
compiling sources in a shared library.  If not set here then it is set
to target_EXPORTS by default (with some substitutions if the target is
not a valid C identifier).  This is useful for headers to know whether
they are being included from inside their library or outside to
properly setup dllexport/dllimport decorations.
.SS DEPLOYMENT_REMOTE_DIRECTORY
.sp
Set the WinCE project \fBRemoteDirectory\fP in \fBDeploymentTool\fP and
\fBRemoteExecutable\fP in \fBDebuggerTool\fP in \fB\&.vcproj\fP files generated
by the \fBVisual Studio 9 2008\fP and \fBVisual Studio 8 2005\fP
generators.  This is useful when you want to debug on remote WinCE device.
For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

.nf
.ft C
set_property(TARGET ${TARGET} PROPERTY
  DEPLOYMENT_REMOTE_DIRECTORY "\e\eFlashStorage")

.SS EchoString
.sp
A message to be displayed when the target is built.
.sp
A message to display on some generators (such as makefiles) when the
target is built.
.SS ENABLE_EXPORTS
.sp
Specify whether an executable exports symbols for loadable modules.
.sp
Normally an executable does not export any symbols because it is the
final program.  It is possible for an executable to export symbols to
be used by loadable modules.  When this property is set to true CMake
will allow other targets to "link" to the executable with the
\fBTARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES()\fP command.  On all platforms a target\-level
dependency on the executable is created for targets that link to it.
For DLL platforms an import library will be created for the exported
symbols and then used for linking.  All Windows\-based systems
including Cygwin are DLL platforms.  For non\-DLL platforms that
require all symbols to be resolved at link time, such as OS X, the
module will "link" to the executable using a flag like
\fB\-bundle_loader\fP\&.  For other non\-DLL platforms the link rule is simply
ignored since the dynamic loader will automatically bind symbols when
the module is loaded.
.sp
This property is initialized by the value of the variable
\fBCMAKE_ENABLE_EXPORTS\fP if it is set when a target is created.
.SS EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL
.sp
Exclude the target from the all target.
.sp
A property on a target that indicates if the target is excluded from
the default build target.  If it is not, then with a Makefile for
example typing make will cause this target to be built.  The same
concept applies to the default build of other generators.  Installing
a target with EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL set to true has undefined behavior.
.SS EXCLUDE_FROM_DEFAULT_BUILD_<CONFIG>
.sp
Per\-configuration version of target exclusion from "Build Solution".
.sp
This is the configuration\-specific version of
EXCLUDE_FROM_DEFAULT_BUILD.  If the generic EXCLUDE_FROM_DEFAULT_BUILD
is also set on a target, EXCLUDE_FROM_DEFAULT_BUILD_<CONFIG> takes
precedence in configurations for which it has a value.
.SS EXCLUDE_FROM_DEFAULT_BUILD
.sp
Exclude target from "Build Solution".
.sp
This property is only used by Visual Studio generators.
When set to TRUE, the target will not be built when you press "Build
Solution".
.SS EXPORT_NAME
.sp
Exported name for target files.
.sp
This sets the name for the IMPORTED target generated when it this
target is is exported.  If not set, the logical target name is used by
default.
.SS FOLDER
.sp
Set the folder name. Use to organize targets in an IDE.
.sp
Targets with no FOLDER property will appear as top level entities in
IDEs like Visual Studio.  Targets with the same FOLDER property value
will appear next to each other in a folder of that name.  To nest
folders, use FOLDER values such as \(aqGUI/Dialogs\(aq with \(aq/\(aq characters
separating folder levels.
.SS Fortran_FORMAT
.sp
Set to FIXED or FREE to indicate the Fortran source layout.
.sp
This property tells CMake whether the Fortran source files in a target
use fixed\-format or free\-format.  CMake will pass the corresponding
format flag to the compiler.  Use the source\-specific Fortran_FORMAT
property to change the format of a specific source file.  If the
variable CMAKE_Fortran_FORMAT is set when a target is created its
value is used to initialize this property.
.SS Fortran_MODULE_DIRECTORY
.sp
Specify output directory for Fortran modules provided by the target.
.sp
If the target contains Fortran source files that provide modules and
the compiler supports a module output directory this specifies the
directory in which the modules will be placed.  When this property is
not set the modules will be placed in the build directory
corresponding to the target\(aqs source directory.  If the variable
CMAKE_Fortran_MODULE_DIRECTORY is set when a target is created its
value is used to initialize this property.
.sp
Note that some compilers will automatically search the module output
directory for modules USEd during compilation but others will not.  If
your sources USE modules their location must be specified by
INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES regardless of this property.
.SS FRAMEWORK
.sp
Build \fBSHARED\fP or \fBSTATIC\fP library as Framework Bundle on the OS X and iOS.
.sp
If such a library target has this property set to \fBTRUE\fP it will be
built as a framework when built on the OS X and iOS.  It will have the
directory structure required for a framework and will be suitable to
be used with the \fB\-framework\fP option
.sp
To customize \fBInfo.plist\fP file in the framework, use
\fBMACOSX_FRAMEWORK_INFO_PLIST\fP target property.
.sp
For OS X see also the \fBFRAMEWORK_VERSION\fP target property.
.sp
Example of creation \fBdynamicFramework\fP:
.INDENT 0.0

.SS FRAMEWORK_VERSION
.sp
Version of a framework created using the \fBFRAMEWORK\fP target
property (e.g. \fBA\fP).
.sp
This property only affects OS X, as iOS doesn\(aqt have versioned
directory structure.
.SS GENERATOR_FILE_NAME
.sp
Generator\(aqs file for this target.
.sp
An internal property used by some generators to record the name of the
project or dsp file associated with this target.  Note that at
configure time, this property is only set for targets created by
include_external_msproject().
.SS GNUtoMS
.sp
Convert GNU import library (.dll.a) to MS format (.lib).
.sp
When linking a shared library or executable that exports symbols using
GNU tools on Windows (MinGW/MSYS) with Visual Studio installed convert
the import library (.dll.a) from GNU to MS format (.lib).  Both import
libraries will be installed by install(TARGETS) and exported by
install(EXPORT) and export() to be linked by applications with either
GNU\- or MS\-compatible tools.
.sp
If the variable CMAKE_GNUtoMS is set when a target is created its
value is used to initialize this property.  The variable must be set
prior to the first command that enables a language such as project()
or enable_language().  CMake provides the variable as an option to the
user automatically when configuring on Windows with GNU tools.
.SS HAS_CXX
.sp
Link the target using the C++ linker tool (obsolete).
.sp
This is equivalent to setting the LINKER_LANGUAGE property to CXX.
See that property\(aqs documentation for details.
.SS IMPLICIT_DEPENDS_INCLUDE_TRANSFORM
.sp
Specify #include line transforms for dependencies in a target.
.sp
This property specifies rules to transform macro\-like #include lines
during implicit dependency scanning of C and C++ source files.  The
list of rules must be semicolon\-separated with each entry of the form
"A_MACRO(%)=value\-with\-%" (the % must be literal).  During dependency
scanning occurrences of A_MACRO(...) on #include lines will be
replaced by the value given with the macro argument substituted for
\(aq%\(aq.  For example, the entry
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf

This property applies to sources in the target on which it is set.
.SS IMPORTED_CONFIGURATIONS
.sp
Configurations provided for an IMPORTED target.
.sp
Set this to the list of configuration names available for an IMPORTED
target.  The names correspond to configurations defined in the project
from which the target is imported.  If the importing project uses a
different set of configurations the names may be mapped using the
MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_<CONFIG> property.  Ignored for non\-imported
targets.
.SS IMPORTED_IMPLIB_<CONFIG>
.sp
<CONFIG>\-specific version of IMPORTED_IMPLIB property.
.sp
Configuration names correspond to those provided by the project from
which the target is imported.
.SS IMPORTED_IMPLIB
.sp
Full path to the import library for an IMPORTED target.
.sp
Set this to the location of the ".lib" part of a windows DLL.  Ignored
for non\-imported targets.
.SS IMPORTED_LIBNAME_<CONFIG>
.sp
<CONFIG>\-specific version of \fBIMPORTED_LIBNAME\fP property.
.sp
Configuration names correspond to those provided by the project from
which the target is imported.
.SS IMPORTED_LIBNAME
.sp
Specify the link library name for an imported
Interface Library\&.
.sp
An interface library builds no library file itself but does specify
usage requirements for its consumers.  The \fBIMPORTED_LIBNAME\fP
property may be set to specify a single library name to be placed
on the link line in place of the interface library target name as
a requirement for using the interface.
.sp
This property is intended for use in naming libraries provided by
a platform SDK for which the full path to a library file may not
be known.  The value may be a plain library name such as \fBfoo\fP
but may \fInot\fP be a path (e.g. \fB/usr/lib/libfoo.so\fP) or a flag
(e.g. \fB\-Wl,...\fP).  The name is never treated as a library target
name even if it happens to name one.
.sp
The \fBIMPORTED_LIBNAME\fP property is allowed only on
imported Interface Libraries
and is rejected on targets of other types (for which
the \fBIMPORTED_LOCATION\fP target property may be used).
.SS IMPORTED_LINK_DEPENDENT_LIBRARIES_<CONFIG>
.sp
<CONFIG>\-specific version of IMPORTED_LINK_DEPENDENT_LIBRARIES.
.sp
Configuration names correspond to those provided by the project from
which the target is imported.  If set, this property completely
overrides the generic property for the named configuration.
.SS IMPORTED_LINK_DEPENDENT_LIBRARIES
.sp
Dependent shared libraries of an imported shared library.
.sp
Shared libraries may be linked to other shared libraries as part of
their implementation.  On some platforms the linker searches for the
dependent libraries of shared libraries they are including in the
link.  Set this property to the list of dependent shared libraries of
an imported library.  The list should be disjoint from the list of
interface libraries in the INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES property.  On
platforms requiring dependent shared libraries to be found at link
time CMake uses this list to add appropriate files or paths to the
link command line.  Ignored for non\-imported targets.
.SS IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LANGUAGES_<CONFIG>
.sp
<CONFIG>\-specific version of IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LANGUAGES.
.sp
Configuration names correspond to those provided by the project from
which the target is imported.  If set, this property completely
overrides the generic property for the named configuration.
.SS IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LANGUAGES
.sp
Languages compiled into an IMPORTED static library.
.sp
Set this to the list of languages of source files compiled to produce
a STATIC IMPORTED library (such as "C" or "CXX").  CMake accounts for
these languages when computing how to link a target to the imported
library.  For example, when a C executable links to an imported C++
static library CMake chooses the C++ linker to satisfy language
runtime dependencies of the static library.
.sp
This property is ignored for targets that are not STATIC libraries.
This property is ignored for non\-imported targets.
.SS IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES_<CONFIG>
.sp
<CONFIG>\-specific version of IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES.
.sp
Configuration names correspond to those provided by the project from
which the target is imported.  If set, this property completely
overrides the generic property for the named configuration.
.sp
This property is ignored if the target also has a non\-empty
INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES property.
.sp
This property is deprecated.  Use INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES instead.
.SS IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES
.sp
Transitive link interface of an IMPORTED target.
.sp
Set this to the list of libraries whose interface is included when an
IMPORTED library target is linked to another target.  The libraries
will be included on the link line for the target.  Unlike the
LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES property, this property applies to all
imported target types, including STATIC libraries.  This property is
ignored for non\-imported targets.
.sp
This property is ignored if the target also has a non\-empty
INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES property.
.sp
This property is deprecated.  Use INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES instead.
.SS IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY_<CONFIG>
.sp
<CONFIG>\-specific version of IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY.
.sp
If set, this property completely overrides the generic property for
the named configuration.
.SS IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY
.sp
Repetition count for cycles of IMPORTED static libraries.
.sp
This is LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY for IMPORTED targets.
.SS IMPORTED_LOCATION_<CONFIG>
.sp
<CONFIG>\-specific version of IMPORTED_LOCATION property.
.sp
Configuration names correspond to those provided by the project from
which the target is imported.
.SS IMPORTED_LOCATION
.sp
Full path to the main file on disk for an IMPORTED target.
.sp
Set this to the location of an IMPORTED target file on disk.  For
executables this is the location of the executable file.  For bundles
on OS X this is the location of the executable file inside
Contents/MacOS under the application bundle folder.  For static
libraries and modules this is the location of the library or module.
For shared libraries on non\-DLL platforms this is the location of the
shared library.  For frameworks on OS X this is the location of the
library file symlink just inside the framework folder.  For DLLs this
is the location of the ".dll" part of the library.  For UNKNOWN
libraries this is the location of the file to be linked.  Ignored for
non\-imported targets.
.sp
Projects may skip IMPORTED_LOCATION if the configuration\-specific
property IMPORTED_LOCATION_<CONFIG> is set.  To get the location of an
imported target read one of the LOCATION or LOCATION_<CONFIG>
properties.
.SS IMPORTED_NO_SONAME_<CONFIG>
.sp
<CONFIG>\-specific version of IMPORTED_NO_SONAME property.
.sp
Configuration names correspond to those provided by the project from
which the target is imported.
.SS IMPORTED_NO_SONAME
.sp
Specifies that an IMPORTED shared library target has no "soname".
.sp
Set this property to true for an imported shared library file that has
no "soname" field.  CMake may adjust generated link commands for some
platforms to prevent the linker from using the path to the library in
place of its missing soname.  Ignored for non\-imported targets.
.SS IMPORTED_OBJECTS_<CONFIG>
.sp
<CONFIG>\-specific version of \fBIMPORTED_OBJECTS\fP property.
.sp
Configuration names correspond to those provided by the project from
which the target is imported.
.SS IMPORTED_OBJECTS
.sp
;\-list of absolute paths to the object
files on disk for an imported
object library\&.
.sp
Ignored for non\-imported targets.
.sp
Projects may skip \fBIMPORTED_OBJECTS\fP if the configuration\-specific
property \fBIMPORTED_OBJECTS_<CONFIG>\fP is set instead.
.SS IMPORTED
.sp
Read\-only indication of whether a target is IMPORTED.
.sp
The boolean value of this property is \fBTrue\fP for targets created with
the IMPORTED option to \fBadd_executable()\fP or \fBadd_library()\fP\&.
It is \fBFalse\fP for targets built within the project.
.SS IMPORTED_SONAME_<CONFIG>
.sp
<CONFIG>\-specific version of IMPORTED_SONAME property.
.sp
Configuration names correspond to those provided by the project from
which the target is imported.
.SS IMPORTED_SONAME
.sp
The "soname" of an IMPORTED target of shared library type.
.sp
Set this to the "soname" embedded in an imported shared library.  This
is meaningful only on platforms supporting the feature.  Ignored for
non\-imported targets.
.SS IMPORT_PREFIX
.sp
What comes before the import library name.
.sp
Similar to the target property PREFIX, but used for import libraries
(typically corresponding to a DLL) instead of regular libraries.  A
target property that can be set to override the prefix (such as "lib")
on an import library name.
.SS IMPORT_SUFFIX
.sp
What comes after the import library name.
.sp
Similar to the target property SUFFIX, but used for import libraries
(typically corresponding to a DLL) instead of regular libraries.  A
target property that can be set to override the suffix (such as
".lib") on an import library name.
.SS INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES
.sp
List of preprocessor include file search directories.
.sp
This property specifies the list of directories given so far to the
\fBtarget_include_directories()\fP command.  In addition to accepting
values from that command, values may be set directly on any
target using the \fBset_property()\fP command.  A target gets its
initial value for this property from the value of the
\fBINCLUDE_DIRECTORIES\fP directory property.  Both directory and
target property values are adjusted by calls to the
\fBinclude_directories()\fP command.
.sp
The value of this property is used by the generators to set the include
paths for the compiler.
.sp
Relative paths should not be added to this property directly. Use one of
the commands above instead to handle relative paths.
.sp
Contents of \fBINCLUDE_DIRECTORIES\fP may use "generator expressions" with
the syntax \fB$<...>\fP\&.  See the \fBcmake\-generator\-expressions(7)\fP
manual for available expressions.  See the \fBcmake\-buildsystem(7)\fP
manual for more on defining buildsystem properties.
.SS INSTALL_NAME_DIR
.sp
Mac OSX directory name for installed targets.
.sp
INSTALL_NAME_DIR is a string specifying the directory portion of the
"install_name" field of shared libraries on Mac OSX to use in the
installed targets.
.SS INSTALL_RPATH
.sp
The rpath to use for installed targets.
.sp
A semicolon\-separated list specifying the rpath to use in installed
targets (for platforms that support it).  This property is initialized
by the value of the variable CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH if it is set when a
target is created.
.SS INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH
.sp
Add paths to linker search and installed rpath.
.sp
INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH is a boolean that if set to true will
append directories in the linker search path and outside the project
to the INSTALL_RPATH.  This property is initialized by the value of
the variable CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH if it is set when a
target is created.
.SS INTERFACE_AUTOUIC_OPTIONS
.sp
List of interface options to pass to uic.
.sp
Targets may populate this property to publish the options
required to use when invoking \fBuic\fP\&.  Consuming targets can add entries to their
own \fBAUTOUIC_OPTIONS\fP property such as
\fB$<TARGET_PROPERTY:foo,INTERFACE_AUTOUIC_OPTIONS>\fP to use the uic options
specified in the interface of \fBfoo\fP\&. This is done automatically by
the \fBtarget_link_libraries()\fP command.
.sp
This property supports generator expressions.  See the
\fBcmake\-generator\-expressions(7)\fP manual for available expressions.
.SS INTERFACE_COMPILE_DEFINITIONS
.sp
List of public compile definitions requirements for a library.
.sp
Targets may populate this property to publish the compile definitions
required to compile against the headers for the target.  The \fBtarget_compile_definitions()\fP
command populates this property with values given to the \fBPUBLIC\fP and
\fBINTERFACE\fP keywords.  Projects may also get and set the property directly.

Targets may populate this property to publish the compile options
required to compile against the headers for the target.  The \fBtarget_compile_options()\fP
command populates this property with values given to the \fBPUBLIC\fP and
\fBINTERFACE\fP keywords.  Projects may also get and set the property directly.

.SS Creating Relocatable Packages
.sp
Note that it is not advisable to populate the \fBINSTALL_INTERFACE\fP of the
\fBINTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES\fP of a target with absolute paths to the include
directories of dependencies.  That would hard\-code into installed packages
the include directory paths for dependencies
\fBas found on the machine the package was made on\fP\&.
.sp
The \fBINSTALL_INTERFACE\fP of the \fBINTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES\fP is only
suitable for specifying the required include directories for headers
provided with the target itself, not those provided by the transitive
dependencies listed in its \fBINTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES\fP target
property.  Those dependencies should themselves be targets that specify
their own header locations in \fBINTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES\fP\&.
.sp
See the Creating Relocatable Packages section of the
\fBcmake\-packages(7)\fP manual for discussion of additional care
that must be taken when specifying usage requirements while creating
packages for redistribution.
.SS INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES
.sp
List public interface libraries for a library.
.sp
This property contains the list of transitive link dependencies.  When
the target is linked into another target using the
\fBtarget_link_libraries()\fP command, the libraries listed (and
recursively their link interface libraries) will be provided to the
other target also.  This property is overridden by the
\fBLINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES\fP or
\fBLINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES_<CONFIG>\fP property if policy
\fBCMP0022\fP is \fBOLD\fP or unset.
.sp
Contents of \fBINTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES\fP may use "generator expressions"

.SS Creating Relocatable Packages
.sp
Note that it is not advisable to populate the
\fBINTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES\fP of a target with absolute paths to dependencies.
That would hard\-code into installed packages the library file paths
for dependencies \fBas found on the machine the package was made on\fP\&.
.sp
See the Creating Relocatable Packages section of the
\fBcmake\-packages(7)\fP manual for discussion of additional care
that must be taken when specifying usage requirements while creating

.SS INTERFACE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE
.sp
Whether consumers need to create a position\-independent target
.sp
The \fBINTERFACE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE\fP property informs consumers of
this target whether they must set their
\fBPOSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE\fP property to \fBON\fP\&.  If this
property is set to \fBON\fP, then the \fBPOSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE\fP
property on  all consumers will be set to \fBON\fP\&. Similarly, if this
property is set to \fBOFF\fP, then the \fBPOSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE\fP
property on all consumers will be set to \fBOFF\fP\&.  If this property is
undefined, then consumers will determine their
\fBPOSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE\fP property by other means.  Consumers
must ensure that the targets that they link to have a consistent
requirement for their \fBINTERFACE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE\fP property.
.SS INTERFACE_SOURCES
.sp
List of interface sources to compile into consuming targets.
.sp
Targets may populate this property to publish the sources
for consuming targets to compile.  The \fBtarget_sources()\fP command
populates this property with values given to the \fBPUBLIC\fP and
\fBINTERFACE\fP keywords.  Projects may also get and set the property directly.
.sp
When target dependencies are specified using \fBtarget_link_libraries()\fP,
CMake will read this property from all target dependencies to determine the
sources of the consumer.
.sp
Contents of \fBINTERFACE_SOURCES\fP may use "generator expressions"
with the syntax \fB$<...>\fP\&.  See the \fBcmake\-generator\-expressions(7)\fP
manual for available expressions.  See the \fBcmake\-buildsystem(7)\fP
manual for more on defining buildsystem properties.
.SS INTERFACE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES
.sp
List of public system include directories for a library.
.sp
Targets may populate this property to publish the include directories
which contain system headers, and therefore should not result in
compiler warnings.  The \fBtarget_include_directories(SYSTEM)\fP
command signature populates this property with values given to the
\fBPUBLIC\fP and \fBINTERFACE\fP keywords.
.sp
Projects may also get and set the property directly, but must be aware that
adding directories to this property does not make those directories used
during compilation.  Adding directories to this property marks directories
as \fBSYSTEM\fP which otherwise would be used in a non\-\fBSYSTEM\fP manner.  This
can appear similar to \(aqduplication\(aq, so prefer the
high\-level \fBtarget_include_directories(SYSTEM)\fP command and avoid
setting the property by low\-level means.
.sp
When target dependencies are specified using \fBtarget_link_libraries()\fP,
CMake will read this property from all target dependencies to mark the
same include directories as containing system headers.
.sp
Contents of \fBINTERFACE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES\fP may use "generator
expressions" with the syntax \fB$<...>\fP\&.  See the
\fBcmake\-generator\-expressions(7)\fP manual for available expressions.
See the \fBcmake\-buildsystem(7)\fP manual for more on defining
buildsystem properties.
.SS INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION_<CONFIG>
.sp
Per\-configuration interprocedural optimization for a target.
.sp
This is a per\-configuration version of INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION.
If set, this property overrides the generic property for the named
configuration.
.sp
This property is initialized by the
\fBCMAKE_INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION_<CONFIG>\fP variable if it is set
when a target is created.
.SS INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION
.sp
Enable interprocedural optimization for a target.
.sp
If set to true, enables interprocedural optimizations if they are
known to be supported by the compiler.
.sp
This property is initialized by the
\fBCMAKE_INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION\fP variable if it is set when a
target is created.
.SS IOS_INSTALL_COMBINED
.sp
Build a combined (device and simulator) target when installing.
.sp
When this property is set to set to false (which is the default) then it will
either be built with the device SDK or the simulator SDK depending on the SDK
set. But if this property is set to true then the target will at install time
also be built for the corresponding SDK and combined into one library.
.sp
This feature requires at least Xcode version 6.
.SS JOB_POOL_COMPILE
.sp
Ninja only: Pool used for compiling.
.sp
The number of parallel compile processes could be limited by defining
pools with the global \fBJOB_POOLS\fP
property and then specifying here the pool name.
.sp
For instance:

.sp
Target label semantics are currently unspecified.
.SS <LANG>_CLANG_TIDY
.sp
This property is implemented only when \fB<LANG>\fP is \fBC\fP or \fBCXX\fP\&.
.sp
Specify a ;\-list containing a command
line for the \fBclang\-tidy\fP tool.  The Makefile Generators
and the \fBNinja\fP generator will run this tool along with the
compiler and report a warning if the tool reports any problems.
.sp
This property is initialized by the value of
the \fBCMAKE_<LANG>_CLANG_TIDY\fP variable if it is set
when a target is created.
.SS <LANG>_COMPILER_LAUNCHER
.sp
This property is implemented only when \fB<LANG>\fP is \fBC\fP, \fBCXX\fP,
or \fBCUDA\fP\&.
.sp
Specify a ;\-list containing a command line
for a compiler launching tool. The Makefile Generators and the
\fBNinja\fP generator will run this tool and pass the compiler and
its arguments to the tool. Some example tools are distcc and ccache.
.sp
This property is initialized by the value of
the \fBCMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_LAUNCHER\fP variable if it is set
when a target is created.
.SS <LANG>_CPPCHECK
.sp
This property is supported only when \fB<LANG>\fP is \fBC\fP or \fBCXX\fP\&.
.sp
Specify a ;\-list containing a command line

This property is initialized by the value of the
\fBCMAKE_<LANG>_CPPCHECK\fP variable if it is set when a target is
created.
.SS <LANG>_CPPLINT
.sp
This property is supported only when \fB<LANG>\fP is \fBC\fP or \fBCXX\fP\&.
.sp
Specify a ;\-list containing a command line
for the \fBcpplint\fP style checker.  The Makefile Generators and the
\fBNinja\fP generator will run \fBcpplint\fP along with the compiler
and report any problems.
.sp
This property is initialized by the value of the
\fBCMAKE_<LANG>_CPPLINT\fP variable if it is set when a target is
created.
.SS <LANG>_INCLUDE_WHAT_YOU_USE
.sp
This property is implemented only when \fB<LANG>\fP is \fBC\fP or \fBCXX\fP\&.
.sp
Specify a ;\-list containing a command
line for the \fBinclude\-what\-you\-use\fP tool.  The Makefile Generators
and the \fBNinja\fP generator will run this tool along with the
compiler and report a warning if the tool reports any problems.
.sp
This property is initialized by the value of
the \fBCMAKE_<LANG>_INCLUDE_WHAT_YOU_USE\fP variable if it is set
when a target is created.
.SS <LANG>_VISIBILITY_PRESET
.sp
Value for symbol visibility compile flags
.sp
The \fB<LANG>_VISIBILITY_PRESET\fP property determines the value passed in a
visibility related compile option, such as \fB\-fvisibility=\fP for \fB<LANG>\fP\&.
This property affects compilation in sources of all types of targets
(subject to policy \fBCMP0063\fP).
.sp
This property is initialized by the value of the
\fBCMAKE_<LANG>_VISIBILITY_PRESET\fP variable if it is set when a
target is created.
.SS LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_<CONFIG>
.sp
Per\-configuration output directory for
LIBRARY target files.
.sp
This is a per\-configuration version of the
\fBLIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY\fP target property, but
multi\-configuration generators (VS, Xcode) do NOT append a
per\-configuration subdirectory to the specified directory.  This
property is initialized by the value of the
\fBCMAKE_LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_<CONFIG>\fP variable if
it is set when a target is created.
.sp
Contents of \fBLIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_<CONFIG>\fP may use
\fBgenerator expressions\fP\&.
.SS LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
.sp
Output directory in which to build LIBRARY target files.
.sp
This property specifies the directory into which library target files
should be built.  The property value may use
\fBgenerator expressions\fP\&.
Multi\-configuration generators (VS, Xcode) append a per\-configuration
subdirectory to the specified directory unless a generator expression
is used.
.sp
This property is initialized by the value of the variable
CMAKE_LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY if it is set when a target is created.
.sp
See also the \fBLIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_<CONFIG>\fP target property.
.SS LIBRARY_OUTPUT_NAME_<CONFIG>
.sp
Per\-configuration output name for
LIBRARY target files.
.sp
This is the configuration\-specific version of the
\fBLIBRARY_OUTPUT_NAME\fP target property.
.SS LIBRARY_OUTPUT_NAME
.sp
Output name for LIBRARY target files.
.sp
This property specifies the base name for library target files.  It
overrides \fBOUTPUT_NAME\fP and \fBOUTPUT_NAME_<CONFIG>\fP
properties.
.sp
See also the \fBLIBRARY_OUTPUT_NAME_<CONFIG>\fP target property.
.SS LINK_DEPENDS_NO_SHARED
.sp
Do not depend on linked shared library files.
.sp
Set this property to true to tell CMake generators not to add
file\-level dependencies on the shared library files linked by this
target.  Modification to the shared libraries will not be sufficient
to re\-link this target.  Logical target\-level dependencies will not be
affected so the linked shared libraries will still be brought up to
date before this target is built.
.sp
This property is initialized by the value of the variable
CMAKE_LINK_DEPENDS_NO_SHARED if it is set when a target is created.
.SS LINK_DEPENDS
.sp
Additional files on which a target binary depends for linking.
.sp
Specifies a semicolon\-separated list of full\-paths to files on which
the link rule for this target depends.  The target binary will be
linked if any of the named files is newer than it.
.sp
This property is ignored by non\-Makefile generators.  It is intended
to specify dependencies on "linker scripts" for custom Makefile link
rules.
.SS LINKER_LANGUAGE
.sp
Specifies language whose compiler will invoke the linker.
.sp
For executables, shared libraries, and modules, this sets the language
whose compiler is used to link the target (such as "C" or "CXX").  A
typical value for an executable is the language of the source file
providing the program entry point (main).  If not set, the language
with the highest linker preference value is the default.  See
documentation of CMAKE_<LANG>_LINKER_PREFERENCE variables.
.sp
If this property is not set by the user, it will be calculated at
generate\-time by CMake.
.SS LINK_FLAGS_<CONFIG>
.sp
Per\-configuration linker flags for a target.
.sp
This is the configuration\-specific version of LINK_FLAGS.
.SS LINK_FLAGS
.sp
Additional flags to use when linking this target.
.sp
The LINK_FLAGS property can be used to add extra flags to the link
step of a target.  LINK_FLAGS_<CONFIG> will add to the configuration
<CONFIG>, for example, DEBUG, RELEASE, MINSIZEREL, RELWITHDEBINFO.
.SS LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES_<CONFIG>
.sp
Per\-configuration list of public interface libraries for a target.
.sp
This is the configuration\-specific version of
\fBLINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES\fP\&.  If set, this property completely
overrides the generic property for the named configuration.
.sp
This property is overridden by the \fBINTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES\fP
property if policy \fBCMP0022\fP is \fBNEW\fP\&.
.sp
This property is deprecated.  Use \fBINTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES\fP
instead.
.SS Creating Relocatable Packages
.sp
Note that it is not advisable to populate the
\fBLINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES_<CONFIG>\fP of a target with absolute paths to dependencies.
That would hard\-code into installed packages the library file paths
for dependencies \fBas found on the machine the package was made on\fP\&.
.sp
See the Creating Relocatable Packages section of the
\fBcmake\-packages(7)\fP manual for discussion of additional care
that must be taken when specifying usage requirements while creating
packages for redistribution.
.SS LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES
.sp
List public interface libraries for a shared library or executable.
.sp
By default linking to a shared library target transitively links to
targets with which the library itself was linked.  For an executable
with exports (see the \fBENABLE_EXPORTS\fP target property) no
default transitive link dependencies are used.  This property replaces the default
transitive link dependencies with an explicit list.  When the target
is linked into another target using the \fBtarget_link_libraries()\fP
command, the libraries listed (and recursively
their link interface libraries) will be provided to the other target
also.  If the list is empty then no transitive link dependencies will
be incorporated when this target is linked into another target even if
the default set is non\-empty.  This property is initialized by the
value of the \fBCMAKE_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES\fP variable if it is
set when a target is created.  This property is ignored for \fBSTATIC\fP
libraries.
.sp
This property is overridden by the \fBINTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES\fP
property if policy \fBCMP0022\fP is \fBNEW\fP\&.
.sp
This property is deprecated.  Use \fBINTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES\fP
instead.
.SS Creating Relocatable Packages
.sp
Note that it is not advisable to populate the

.SS LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY_<CONFIG>
.sp
Per\-configuration repetition count for cycles of STATIC libraries.
.sp
This is the configuration\-specific version of
LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY.  If set, this property completely
overrides the generic property for the named configuration.
.SS LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY
.sp
Repetition count for STATIC libraries with cyclic dependencies.
.sp
When linking to a STATIC library target with cyclic dependencies the
linker may need to scan more than once through the archives in the
strongly connected component of the dependency graph.  CMake by
default constructs the link line so that the linker will scan through
the component at least twice.  This property specifies the minimum
number of scans if it is larger than the default.  CMake uses the
largest value specified by any target in a component.
.SS LINK_LIBRARIES
.sp
List of direct link dependencies.
.sp
This property specifies the list of libraries or targets which will be
used for linking.  In addition to accepting values from the
\fBtarget_link_libraries()\fP command, values may be set directly on
any target using the \fBset_property()\fP command.
.sp
The value of this property is used by the generators to set the link
libraries for the compiler.
.sp
Contents of \fBLINK_LIBRARIES\fP may use "generator expressions" with the
syntax \fB$<...>\fP\&.  See the \fBcmake\-generator\-expressions(7)\fP manual
for available expressions.  See the \fBcmake\-buildsystem(7)\fP manual
for more on defining buildsystem properties.
.SS LINK_SEARCH_END_STATIC
.sp
End a link line such that static system libraries are used.
.sp
Some linkers support switches such as \-Bstatic and \-Bdynamic to
determine whether to use static or shared libraries for \-lXXX options.
CMake uses these options to set the link type for libraries whose full
paths are not known or (in some cases) are in implicit link
directories for the platform.  By default CMake adds an option at the
end of the library list (if necessary) to set the linker search type
back to its starting type.  This property switches the final linker
search type to \-Bstatic regardless of how it started.
.sp
This property is initialized by the value of the variable
CMAKE_LINK_SEARCH_END_STATIC if it is set when a target is created.
.sp
See also LINK_SEARCH_START_STATIC.
.SS LINK_SEARCH_START_STATIC
.sp
Assume the linker looks for static libraries by default.
.sp
Some linkers support switches such as \-Bstatic and \-Bdynamic to
determine whether to use static or shared libraries for \-lXXX options.
CMake uses these options to set the link type for libraries whose full
paths are not known or (in some cases) are in implicit link
directories for the platform.  By default the linker search type is
assumed to be \-Bdynamic at the beginning of the library list.  This
property switches the assumption to \-Bstatic.  It is intended for use
when linking an executable statically (e.g.  with the GNU \-static
option).
.sp
This property is initialized by the value of the variable
CMAKE_LINK_SEARCH_START_STATIC if it is set when a target is created.
.sp
See also LINK_SEARCH_END_STATIC.
.SS LINK_WHAT_YOU_USE
.sp
This is a boolean option that when set to \fBTRUE\fP will automatically run
\fBldd \-r \-u\fP on the target after it is linked. In addition, the linker flag
\fB\-Wl,\-\-no\-as\-needed\fP will be passed to the target with the link command so
that all libraries specified on the command line will be linked into the
target. This will result in the link producing a list of libraries that
provide no symbols used by this target but are being linked to it.
This is only applicable to executable and shared library targets and
will only work when ld and ldd accept the flags used.
.sp
This property is initialized by the value of
the \fBCMAKE_LINK_WHAT_YOU_USE\fP variable if it is set
when a target is created.
.SS LOCATION_<CONFIG>
.sp
Read\-only property providing a target location on disk.
.sp
A read\-only property that indicates where a target\(aqs main file is
located on disk for the configuration <CONFIG>.  The property is
defined only for library and executable targets.  An imported target
may provide a set of configurations different from that of the
importing project.  By default CMake looks for an exact\-match but
otherwise uses an arbitrary available configuration.  Use the
MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_<CONFIG> property to map imported configurations
explicitly.
.sp
Do not set properties that affect the location of a target after
reading this property.  These include properties whose names match
"(RUNTIME|LIBRARY|ARCHIVE)_OUTPUT_(NAME|DIRECTORY)(_<CONFIG>)?",
\fB(IMPLIB_)?(PREFIX|SUFFIX)\fP, or "LINKER_LANGUAGE".  Failure to follow
this rule is not diagnosed and leaves the location of the target
undefined.
.SS LOCATION
.sp
Read\-only location of a target on disk.
.sp
For an imported target, this read\-only property returns the value of
the LOCATION_<CONFIG> property for an unspecified configuration
<CONFIG> provided by the target.
.sp
For a non\-imported target, this property is provided for compatibility
with CMake 2.4 and below.  It was meant to get the location of an
executable target\(aqs output file for use in add_custom_command.  The
path may contain a build\-system\-specific portion that is replaced at
build time with the configuration getting built (such as
"$(ConfigurationName)" in VS).  In CMake 2.6 and above
add_custom_command automatically recognizes a target name in its
COMMAND and DEPENDS options and computes the target location.  In
CMake 2.8.4 and above add_custom_command recognizes generator
expressions to refer to target locations anywhere in the command.
Therefore this property is not needed for creating custom commands.
.sp
Do not set properties that affect the location of a target after
reading this property.  These include properties whose names match
"(RUNTIME|LIBRARY|ARCHIVE)_OUTPUT_(NAME|DIRECTORY)(_<CONFIG>)?",
\fB(IMPLIB_)?(PREFIX|SUFFIX)\fP, or "LINKER_LANGUAGE".  Failure to follow
this rule is not diagnosed and leaves the location of the target
undefined.
.SS MACOSX_BUNDLE_INFO_PLIST
.sp
Specify a custom \fBInfo.plist\fP template for a OS X and iOS Application Bundle.
.sp
An executable target with \fBMACOSX_BUNDLE\fP enabled will be built as an
application bundle on OS X.  By default its \fBInfo.plist\fP file is created
by configuring a template called \fBMacOSXBundleInfo.plist.in\fP located in the
\fBCMAKE_MODULE_PATH\fP\&.  This property specifies an alternative template
file name which may be a full path.
.sp
The following target properties may be set to specify content to be
configured into the file:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBMACOSX_BUNDLE_BUNDLE_NAME\fP
Sets \fBCFBundleName\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBMACOSX_BUNDLE_BUNDLE_VERSION\fP
Sets \fBCFBundleVersion\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBMACOSX_BUNDLE_COPYRIGHT\fP
Sets \fBNSHumanReadableCopyright\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBMACOSX_BUNDLE_GUI_IDENTIFIER\fP
Sets \fBCFBundleIdentifier\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBMACOSX_BUNDLE_ICON_FILE\fP
Sets \fBCFBundleIconFile\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBMACOSX_BUNDLE_INFO_STRING\fP
Sets \fBCFBundleGetInfoString\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBMACOSX_BUNDLE_LONG_VERSION_STRING\fP
Sets \fBCFBundleLongVersionString\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBMACOSX_BUNDLE_SHORT_VERSION_STRING\fP
Sets \fBCFBundleShortVersionString\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.sp
CMake variables of the same name may be set to affect all targets in a
directory that do not have each specific property set.  If a custom
\fBInfo.plist\fP is specified by this property it may of course hard\-code
all the settings instead of using the target properties.
.SS MACOSX_BUNDLE
.sp
Build an executable as an Application Bundle on OS X or iOS.
.sp
When this property is set to \fBTRUE\fP the executable when built on OS X
or iOS will be created as an application bundle.  This makes it
a GUI executable that can be launched from the Finder.  See the
\fBMACOSX_BUNDLE_INFO_PLIST\fP target property for information about
creation of the \fBInfo.plist\fP file for the application bundle.
This property is initialized by the value of the variable
\fBCMAKE_MACOSX_BUNDLE\fP if it is set when a target is created.
.SS MACOSX_FRAMEWORK_INFO_PLIST
.sp
Specify a custom \fBInfo.plist\fP template for a OS X and iOS Framework.
.sp
A library target with \fBFRAMEWORK\fP enabled will be built as a
framework on OS X.  By default its \fBInfo.plist\fP file is created by
configuring a template called \fBMacOSXFrameworkInfo.plist.in\fP located in the
\fBCMAKE_MODULE_PATH\fP\&.  This property specifies an alternative template
file name which may be a full path.
.sp
The following target properties may be set to specify content to be
configured into the file:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBMACOSX_FRAMEWORK_BUNDLE_VERSION\fP
Sets \fBCFBundleVersion\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBMACOSX_FRAMEWORK_ICON_FILE\fP
Sets \fBCFBundleIconFile\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBMACOSX_FRAMEWORK_IDENTIFIER\fP
Sets \fBCFBundleIdentifier\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBMACOSX_FRAMEWORK_SHORT_VERSION_STRING\fP
Sets \fBCFBundleShortVersionString\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.sp
CMake variables of the same name may be set to affect all targets in a
directory that do not have each specific property set.  If a custom
\fBInfo.plist\fP is specified by this property it may of course hard\-code
all the settings instead of using the target properties.
.SS MACOSX_RPATH
.sp
Whether this target on OS X or iOS is located at runtime using rpaths.
.sp
When this property is set to \fBTRUE\fP, the directory portion of
the \fBinstall_name\fP field of this shared library will be \fB@rpath\fP
unless overridden by \fBINSTALL_NAME_DIR\fP\&.  This indicates
the shared library is to be found at runtime using runtime
paths (rpaths).
.sp
This property is initialized by the value of the variable
\fBCMAKE_MACOSX_RPATH\fP if it is set when a target is
created.
.sp
Runtime paths will also be embedded in binaries using this target and
can be controlled by the \fBINSTALL_RPATH\fP target property on
the target linking to this target.
.sp
Policy \fBCMP0042\fP was introduced to change the default value of
\fBMACOSX_RPATH\fP to \fBTRUE\fP\&.  This is because use of \fB@rpath\fP is a
more flexible and powerful alternative to \fB@executable_path\fP and
\fB@loader_path\fP\&.
.SS MANUALLY_ADDED_DEPENDENCIES
.sp
Get manually added dependencies to other top\-level targets.
.sp
This read\-only property can be used to query all dependencies that
were added for this target with the \fBadd_dependencies()\fP
command.
.SS MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_<CONFIG>
.sp
Map from project configuration to
imported target\(aqs configuration.
.sp
Set this to the list of configurations of an imported target that may
be used for the current project\(aqs \fB<CONFIG>\fP configuration.  Targets
imported from another project may not provide the same set of
configuration names available in the current project.  Setting this
property tells CMake what imported configurations are suitable for use
when building the \fB<CONFIG>\fP configuration.  The first configuration in
the list found to be provided by the imported target (i.e. via
\fBIMPORTED_LOCATION_<CONFIG>\fP for the mapped\-to \fB<CONFIG>\fP)
is selected.  As a special case, an empty list element refers to the
configuration\-less imported target location
(i.e. \fBIMPORTED_LOCATION\fP).
.sp
If this property is set and no matching configurations are available,
then the imported target is considered to be not found.  This property
is ignored for non\-imported targets.
.sp
This property is initialized by the value of the
\fBCMAKE_MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_<CONFIG>\fP variable if it is set when a
target is created.
.SS Example

.SS NO_SONAME
.sp
Whether to set "soname" when linking a shared library.
.sp
Enable this boolean property if a generated shared library
should not have "soname" set.  Default is to set "soname" on all
shared libraries as long as the platform supports it.
Generally, use this property only for leaf private libraries or
plugins.  If you use it on normal shared libraries which other targets
link against, on some platforms a linker will insert a full path to
the library (as specified at link time) into the dynamic section of
the dependent binary.  Therefore, once installed, dynamic loader may
eventually fail to locate the library for the binary.
.SS NO_SYSTEM_FROM_IMPORTED
.sp
Do not treat include directories from the interfaces of consumed
imported targets as \fBSYSTEM\fP\&.
.sp
The contents of the \fBINTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES\fP target property
of imported targets are treated as \fBSYSTEM\fP includes by default.  If this
property is enabled on a target, compilation of sources in that target will
not treat the contents of the \fBINTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES\fP of consumed
imported targets as system includes.
.sp
This property is initialized by the value of the
\fBCMAKE_NO_SYSTEM_FROM_IMPORTED\fP variable if it is set when a target
is created.
.SS OSX_ARCHITECTURES_<CONFIG>
.sp
Per\-configuration OS X and iOS binary architectures for a target.
.sp
This property is the configuration\-specific version of
\fBOSX_ARCHITECTURES\fP\&.
.SS OSX_ARCHITECTURES
.sp
Target specific architectures for OS X.
.sp
The \fBOSX_ARCHITECTURES\fP property sets the target binary architecture for
targets on OS X (\fB\-arch\fP).  This property is initialized by the value of the
variable \fBCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES\fP if it is set when a target is
created.  Use \fBOSX_ARCHITECTURES_<CONFIG>\fP to set the binary
architectures on a per\-configuration basis, where \fB<CONFIG>\fP is an
upper\-case name (e.g. \fBOSX_ARCHITECTURES_DEBUG\fP).
.SS OUTPUT_NAME_<CONFIG>
.sp
Per\-configuration target file base name.
.sp
This is the configuration\-specific version of the \fBOUTPUT_NAME\fP
target property.
.SS OUTPUT_NAME
.sp

keyword for Visual Studio 10 (2010) and newer.
.SS VS_MOBILE_EXTENSIONS_VERSION
.sp
Visual Studio Windows 10 Mobile Extensions Version
.sp
Specifies the version of the Mobile Extensions that should be included in the
target. For example \fB10.0.10240.0\fP\&. If the value is not specified, the Mobile
Extensions will not be included. To use the same version of the extensions as
the Windows 10 SDK that is being used, you can use the
\fBCMAKE_VS_WINDOWS_TARGET_PLATFORM_VERSION\fP variable.
.SS VS_SCC_AUXPATH
.sp
Visual Studio Source Code Control Aux Path.
.sp
Can be set to change the visual studio source code control auxpath
property.
.SS VS_SCC_LOCALPATH
.sp
Visual Studio Source Code Control Local Path.
.sp
Can be set to change the visual studio source code control local path
property.
.SS VS_SCC_PROJECTNAME
.sp
Visual Studio Source Code Control Project.
.sp
Can be set to change the visual studio source code control project
name property.
.SS VS_SCC_PROVIDER
.sp
Visual Studio Source Code Control Provider.
.sp
Can be set to change the visual studio source code control provider
property.
.SS VS_SDK_REFERENCES
.sp
Visual Studio project SDK references.
Specify a ;\-list of SDK references
to be added to a generated Visual Studio project, e.g.
\fBMicrosoft.AdMediatorWindows81, Version=1.0\fP\&.
.SS VS_USER_PROPS
.sp
Sets the user props file to be included in the visual studio
C++ project file. The standard path is
\fB$(UserRootDir)\e\eMicrosoft.Cpp.$(Platform).user.props\fP, which is
in most cases the same as
\fB%LOCALAPPDATA%\e\eMicrosoft\e\eMSBuild\e\ev4.0\e\eMicrosoft.Cpp.Win32.user.props\fP
or \fB%LOCALAPPDATA%\e\eMicrosoft\e\eMSBuild\e\ev4.0\e\eMicrosoft.Cpp.x64.user.props\fP\&.
.sp
The \fB*.user.props\fP files can be used for Visual Studio wide
configuration which is independent from cmake.
.SS VS_WINDOWS_TARGET_PLATFORM_MIN_VERSION
.sp
Visual Studio Windows Target Platform Minimum Version
.sp
For Windows 10. Specifies the minimum version of the OS that is being
targeted. For example \fB10.0.10240.0\fP\&. If the value is not specified, the
value of \fBCMAKE_VS_WINDOWS_TARGET_PLATFORM_VERSION\fP will be used on
WindowsStore projects otherwise the target platform minimum version will not
be specified for the project.
.SS VS_WINRT_COMPONENT
.sp
Mark a target as a Windows Runtime component for the Visual Studio generator.
Compile the target with \fBC++/CX\fP language extensions for Windows Runtime.
For \fBSHARED\fP and \fBMODULE\fP libraries, this also defines the
\fB_WINRT_DLL\fP preprocessor macro.

.SS VS_WINRT_EXTENSIONS
.sp
Deprecated.  Use \fBVS_WINRT_COMPONENT\fP instead.
This property was an experimental partial implementation of that one.
.SS VS_WINRT_REFERENCES
.sp
Visual Studio project Windows Runtime Metadata references
.sp
Adds one or more semicolon\-delimited WinRT references to a generated
Visual Studio project.  For example, "Windows;Windows.UI.Core".
.SS WIN32_EXECUTABLE
.sp
Build an executable with a WinMain entry point on windows.
.sp
When this property is set to true the executable when linked on
Windows will be created with a WinMain() entry point instead of just
main().  This makes it a GUI executable instead of a console
application.  See the CMAKE_MFC_FLAG variable documentation to
configure use of MFC for WinMain executables.  This property is
initialized by the value of the variable CMAKE_WIN32_EXECUTABLE if it
is set when a target is created.
.SS WINDOWS_EXPORT_ALL_SYMBOLS
.sp
This property is implemented only for MS\-compatible tools on Windows.
.sp
Enable this boolean property to automatically create a module definition
(\fB\&.def\fP) file with all global symbols found in the input \fB\&.obj\fP files
for a \fBSHARED\fP library (or executable with \fBENABLE_EXPORTS\fP)
on Windows.  The module definition file will be passed to the linker
causing all symbols to be exported from the \fB\&.dll\fP\&.
For global \fIdata\fP symbols, \fB__declspec(dllimport)\fP must still be used when
compiling against the code in the \fB\&.dll\fP\&.  All other function symbols will
be automatically exported and imported by callers.  This simplifies porting
projects to Windows by reducing the need for explicit \fBdllexport\fP markup,
even in \fBC++\fP classes.
.sp
When this property is enabled, zero or more \fB\&.def\fP files may also be
specified as source files of the target.  The exports named by these files
will be merged with those detected from the object files to generate a
single module definition file to be passed to the linker.  This can be
used to export symbols from a \fB\&.dll\fP that are not in any of its object
files but are added by the linker from dependencies (e.g. \fBmsvcrt.lib\fP).
.sp
This property is initialized by the value of
the \fBCMAKE_WINDOWS_EXPORT_ALL_SYMBOLS\fP variable if it is set
when a target is created.
.SS XCODE_ATTRIBUTE_<an\-attribute>
.sp
Set Xcode target attributes directly.
.sp
Tell the Xcode generator to set \(aq<an\-attribute>\(aq to a given value in
the generated Xcode project.  Ignored on other generators.
.sp
See the \fBCMAKE_XCODE_ATTRIBUTE_<an\-attribute>\fP variable
to set attributes on all targets in a directory tree.
.sp
Contents of \fBXCODE_ATTRIBUTE_<an\-attribute>\fP may use
"generator expressions" with the syntax \fB$<...>\fP\&.  See the
\fBcmake\-generator\-expressions(7)\fP manual for available
expressions.  See the \fBcmake\-buildsystem(7)\fP manual
for more on defining buildsystem properties.
.SS XCODE_EXPLICIT_FILE_TYPE
.sp
Set the Xcode \fBexplicitFileType\fP attribute on its reference to a
target.  CMake computes a default based on target type but
can be told explicitly with this property.
.sp
See also \fBXCODE_PRODUCT_TYPE\fP\&.
.SS XCODE_PRODUCT_TYPE
.sp
Set the Xcode \fBproductType\fP attribute on its reference to a
target.  CMake computes a default based on target type but
can be told explicitly with this property.
.sp
See also \fBXCODE_EXPLICIT_FILE_TYPE\fP\&.
.SS XCTEST
.sp
This target is a XCTest CFBundle on the Mac.
.sp
This property will usually get set via the \fBxctest_add_bundle()\fP
macro in \fBFindXCTest\fP module.
.sp
If a module library target has this property set to true it will be
built as a CFBundle when built on the Mac.  It will have the directory
structure required for a CFBundle.
.sp
This property depends on \fBBUNDLE\fP to be effective.
.SH PROPERTIES ON TESTS
.SS ATTACHED_FILES_ON_FAIL
.sp
Attach a list of files to a dashboard submission if the test fails.
.sp
Same as \fBATTACHED_FILES\fP, but these files will only be
included if the test does not pass.
.SS ATTACHED_FILES
.sp
Attach a list of files to a dashboard submission.
.sp
Set this property to a list of files that will be encoded and
submitted to the dashboard as an addition to the test result.
.SS COST
.sp
Set this to a floating point value. Tests in a test set will be run in descending order of cost.
.sp
This property describes the cost of a test.  You can explicitly set
this value; tests with higher COST values will run first.
.SS DEPENDS
.sp
Specifies that this test should only be run after the specified list of tests.
.sp
Set this to a list of tests that must finish before this test is run. The
results of those tests are not considered, the dependency relationship is
purely for order of execution (i.e. it is really just a \fIrun after\fP
relationship). Consider using test fixtures with setup tests if a dependency
with successful completion is required (see \fBFIXTURES_REQUIRED\fP).
.SS DISABLED
.sp
If set to true, the test will be skipped and its status will be \(aqNot Run\(aq. A
DISABLED test will not be counted in the total number of tests and its
completion status will be reported to CDash as \(aqDisabled\(aq.
.sp
A DISABLED test does not participate in test fixture dependency resolution.
If a DISABLED test has fixture requirements defined in its
\fBFIXTURES_REQUIRED\fP property, it will not cause setup or cleanup
tests for those fixtures to be added to the test set.
.sp
If a test with the \fBFIXTURES_SETUP\fP property set is DISABLED, the
fixture behavior will be as though that setup test was passing and any test
case requiring that fixture will still run.
.SS ENVIRONMENT
.sp
Specify environment variables that should be defined for running a test.
.sp
If set to a list of environment variables and values of the form
MYVAR=value those environment variables will be defined while running
the test.  The environment is restored to its previous state after the
test is done.
.SS FAIL_REGULAR_EXPRESSION
.sp
If the output matches this regular expression the test will fail.
.sp
If set, if the output matches one of specified regular expressions,
the test will fail.  Example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
set_tests_properties(mytest PROPERTIES
  FAIL_REGULAR_EXPRESSION "[^a\-z]Error;ERROR;Failed"
)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBFAIL_REGULAR_EXPRESSION\fP expects a list of regular expressions.
.SS FIXTURES_CLEANUP
.sp
Specifies a list of fixtures for which the test is to be treated as a cleanup
test. These fixture names are distinct from test case names and are not
required to have any similarity to the names of tests associated with them.
.sp
Fixture cleanup tests are ordinary tests with all of the usual test
functionality. Setting the \fBFIXTURES_CLEANUP\fP property for a test has two
primary effects:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
CTest will ensure the test executes after all other tests which list any of
the fixtures in its \fBFIXTURES_REQUIRED\fP property.
.IP \(bu 2
If CTest is asked to run only a subset of tests (e.g. using regular
expressions or the \fB\-\-rerun\-failed\fP option) and the cleanup test is not in
the set of tests to run, it will automatically be added if any tests in the
set require any fixture listed in \fBFIXTURES_CLEANUP\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.sp
A cleanup test can have multiple fixtures listed in its \fBFIXTURES_CLEANUP\fP
property. It will execute only once for the whole CTest run, not once for each
fixture. A fixture can also have more than one cleanup test defined. If there
are multiple cleanup tests for a fixture, projects can control their order with
the usual \fBDEPENDS\fP test property if necessary.
.sp
A cleanup test is allowed to require other fixtures, but not any fixture listed
in its \fBFIXTURES_CLEANUP\fP property. For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# Ok: Dependent fixture is different to cleanup
set_tests_properties(cleanupFoo PROPERTIES
  FIXTURES_CLEANUP  Foo
  FIXTURES_REQUIRED Bar
)

# Error: cannot require same fixture as cleanup
set_tests_properties(cleanupFoo PROPERTIES
  FIXTURES_CLEANUP  Foo
  FIXTURES_REQUIRED Foo
)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Cleanup tests will execute even if setup or regular tests for that fixture fail
or are skipped.
.sp
See \fBFIXTURES_REQUIRED\fP for a more complete discussion of how to use
test fixtures.
.SS FIXTURES_REQUIRED
.sp
Specifies a list of fixtures the test requires. Fixture names are case
sensitive and they are not required to have any similarity to test names.
.sp
Fixtures are a way to attach setup and cleanup tasks to a set of tests. If a
test requires a given fixture, then all tests marked as setup tasks for that
fixture will be executed first (once for the whole set of tests, not once per
test requiring the fixture). After all tests requiring a particular fixture
have completed, CTest will ensure all tests marked as cleanup tasks for that
fixture are then executed. Tests are marked as setup tasks with the
\fBFIXTURES_SETUP\fP property and as cleanup tasks with the
\fBFIXTURES_CLEANUP\fP property. If any of a fixture\(aqs setup tests fail,
all tests listing that fixture in their \fBFIXTURES_REQUIRED\fP property will not
be executed. The cleanup tests for the fixture will always be executed, even if
some setup tests fail.
.sp
When CTest is asked to execute only a subset of tests (e.g. by the use of
regular expressions or when run with the \fB\-\-rerun\-failed\fP command line
option), it will automatically add any setup or cleanup tests for fixtures
required by any of the tests that are in the execution set. This behavior can
be overridden with the \fB\-FS\fP, \fB\-FC\fP and \fB\-FA\fP command line options to
\fBctest(1)\fP if desired.
.sp
Since setup and cleanup tasks are also tests, they can have an ordering
specified by the \fBDEPENDS\fP test property just like any other tests.
This can be exploited to implement setup or cleanup using multiple tests for a
single fixture to modularise setup or cleanup logic.
.sp
The concept of a fixture is different to that of a resource specified by
\fBRESOURCE_LOCK\fP, but they may be used together. A fixture defines a
set of tests which share setup and cleanup requirements, whereas a resource
lock has the effect of ensuring a particular set of tests do not run in
parallel. Some situations may need both, such as setting up a database,
serialising test access to that database and deleting the database again at the
end. For such cases, tests would populate both \fBFIXTURES_REQUIRED\fP and
\fBRESOURCE_LOCK\fP to combine the two behaviours. Names used for
\fBRESOURCE_LOCK\fP have no relationship with names of fixtures, so note
that a resource lock does not imply a fixture and vice versa.
.sp
Consider the following example which represents a database test scenario
similar to that mentioned above:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
add_test(NAME testsDone   COMMAND emailResults)
add_test(NAME fooOnly     COMMAND testFoo)

Key points from this example:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Two fixtures are defined: \fBDB\fP and \fBFoo\fP\&. Tests can require a single
fixture as \fBfooOnly\fP and \fBdbOnly\fP do, or they can depend on multiple
fixtures like \fBdbWithFoo\fP does.
.IP \(bu 2
A \fBDEPENDS\fP relationship is set up to ensure \fBsetupUsers\fP happens after
\fBcreateDB\fP, both of which are setup tests for the \fBDB\fP fixture and will
therefore be executed before the \fBdbOnly\fP and \fBdbWithFoo\fP tests
automatically.
.IP \(bu 2
No explicit \fBDEPENDS\fP relationships were needed to make the setup tests run
before or the cleanup tests run after the regular tests.
.IP \(bu 2
The \fBFoo\fP fixture has no setup tests defined, only a single cleanup test.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBtestsDone\fP is a cleanup test for both the \fBDB\fP and \fBFoo\fP fixtures.
Therefore, it will only execute once regular tests for both fixtures have
finished (i.e. after \fBfooOnly\fP, \fBdbOnly\fP and \fBdbWithFoo\fP). No
\fBDEPENDS\fP relationship was specified for \fBtestsDone\fP, so it is free to
run before, after or concurrently with other cleanup tests for either
fixture.
.IP \(bu 2
The setup and cleanup tests never list the fixtures they are for in their own
\fBFIXTURES_REQUIRED\fP property, as that would result in a dependency on
themselves and be considered an error.
.UNINDENT
.SS FIXTURES_SETUP
.sp
Specifies a list of fixtures for which the test is to be treated as a setup
test. These fixture names are distinct from test case names and are not
required to have any similarity to the names of tests associated with them.
.sp
Fixture setup tests are ordinary tests with all of the usual test

multiple setup tests for a fixture, projects can control their order with the
usual \fBDEPENDS\fP test property if necessary.

however, still be executed.
.sp
See \fBFIXTURES_REQUIRED\fP for a more complete discussion of how to use
test fixtures.
.SS LABELS
.sp
Specify a list of text labels associated with a test.
.sp
The list is reported in dashboard submissions.
.SS MEASUREMENT
.sp
Specify a CDASH measurement and value to be reported for a test.
.sp
If set to a name then that name will be reported to CDASH as a named
measurement with a value of 1.  You may also specify a value by
setting MEASUREMENT to "measurement=value".
.SS PASS_REGULAR_EXPRESSION
.sp
The output must match this regular expression for the test to pass.
.sp
If set, the test output will be checked against the specified regular
expressions and at least one of the regular expressions has to match,
otherwise the test will fail.  Example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

  PASS_REGULAR_EXPRESSION "TestPassed;All ok"

.sp
\fBPASS_REGULAR_EXPRESSION\fP expects a list of regular expressions.
.SS PROCESSORS
.sp
Set to specify how many process slots this test requires.
.sp
Denotes the number of processors that this test will require.  This is
typically used for MPI tests, and should be used in conjunction with
the \fBctest_test()\fP \fBPARALLEL_LEVEL\fP option.
.sp
This will also be used to display a weighted test timing result in label and
subproject summaries in the command line output of \fBctest(1)\fP\&. The wall
clock time for the test run will be multiplied by this property to give a
better idea of how much cpu resource CTest allocated for the test.
.SS REQUIRED_FILES
.sp
List of files required to run the test.
.sp
If set to a list of files, the test will not be run unless all of the
files exist.
.SS RESOURCE_LOCK
.sp
Specify a list of resources that are locked by this test.
.sp
If multiple tests specify the same resource lock, they are guaranteed
not to run concurrently.
.sp
See also \fBFIXTURES_REQUIRED\fP if the resource requires any setup or
cleanup steps.
.SS RUN_SERIAL
.sp
Do not run this test in parallel with any other test.
.sp
Use this option in conjunction with the ctest_test PARALLEL_LEVEL
option to specify that this test should not be run in parallel with
any other tests.
.SS SKIP_RETURN_CODE
.sp
Return code to mark a test as skipped.
.sp
Sometimes only a test itself can determine if all requirements for the
test are met. If such a situation should not be considered a hard failure
a return code of the process can be specified that will mark the test as
"Not Run" if it is encountered.
.SS TIMEOUT
.sp
How many seconds to allow for this test.
.sp
This property if set will limit a test to not take more than the
specified number of seconds to run.  If it exceeds that the test
process will be killed and ctest will move to the next test.  This
setting takes precedence over \fBCTEST_TEST_TIMEOUT\fP\&.
.SS TIMEOUT_AFTER_MATCH

.SS Description
.sp
Allow a test \fBseconds\fP to complete after \fBregex\fP is encountered in
its output.
.sp
When the test outputs a line that matches \fBregex\fP its start time is
reset to the current time and its timeout duration is changed to
\fBseconds\fP\&.  Prior to this, the timeout duration is determined by the
\fBTIMEOUT\fP property or the \fBCTEST_TEST_TIMEOUT\fP
variable if either of these are set.  Because the test\(aqs start time is
reset, its execution time will not include any time that was spent
waiting for the matching output.
.sp
\fI\%TIMEOUT_AFTER_MATCH\fP is useful for avoiding spurious
timeouts when your test must wait for some system resource to become
available before it can execute.  Set \fBTIMEOUT\fP to a longer
duration that accounts for resource acquisition and use
\fI\%TIMEOUT_AFTER_MATCH\fP to control how long the actual test
is allowed to run.
.sp
If the required resource can be controlled by CTest you should use
\fBRESOURCE_LOCK\fP instead of \fI\%TIMEOUT_AFTER_MATCH\fP\&.
This property should be used when only the test itself can determine
when its required resources are available.
.SS WILL_FAIL
.sp
If set to true, this will invert the pass/fail flag of the test.
.sp
This property can be used for tests that are expected to fail and
return a non zero return code.
.SS WORKING_DIRECTORY
.sp
The directory from which the test executable will be called.
.sp
If this is not set it is called from the directory the test executable
is located in.
.SH PROPERTIES ON SOURCE FILES
.SS ABSTRACT
.sp
Is this source file an abstract class.
.sp
A property on a source file that indicates if the source file
represents a class that is abstract.  This only makes sense for
languages that have a notion of an abstract class and it is only used
by some tools that wrap classes into other languages.
.SS AUTOUIC_OPTIONS
.sp
Additional options for \fBuic\fP when using \fBAUTOUIC\fP
.sp
This property holds additional command line options
which will be used when \fBuic\fP is executed during the build via
\fBAUTOUIC\fP, i.e. it is equivalent to the optional \fBOPTIONS\fP
argument of the \fBqt4_wrap_ui()\fP macro.

.SS COMPILE_DEFINITIONS
.sp
Preprocessor definitions for compiling a source file.
.sp
The COMPILE_DEFINITIONS property may be set to a semicolon\-separated
list of preprocessor definitions using the syntax VAR or VAR=value.
Function\-style definitions are not supported.  CMake will
automatically escape the value correctly for the native build system
(note that CMake language syntax may require escapes to specify some
values).  This property may be set on a per\-configuration basis using
the name COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_<CONFIG> where <CONFIG> is an upper\-case
name (ex.  "COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_DEBUG").
.sp
CMake will automatically drop some definitions that are not supported
by the native build tool.  Xcode does not support per\-configuration
definitions on source files.
.sp
Disclaimer: Most native build tools have poor support for escaping
certain values.  CMake has work\-arounds for many cases but some values
may just not be possible to pass correctly.  If a value does not seem
to be escaped correctly, do not attempt to work\-around the problem by
adding escape sequences to the value.  Your work\-around may break in a
future version of CMake that has improved escape support.  Instead
consider defining the macro in a (configured) header file.  Then
report the limitation.  Known limitations include:

Set to FIXED or FREE to indicate the Fortran source layout.
.sp
This property tells CMake whether a given Fortran source file uses
fixed\-format or free\-format.  CMake will pass the corresponding format
flag to the compiler.  Consider using the target\-wide Fortran_FORMAT
property if all source files in a target share the same format.
.SS GENERATED
.sp
Is this source file generated as part of the build process.
.sp
If a source file is generated by the build process CMake will handle
it differently in terms of dependency checking etc.  Otherwise having
a non\-existent source file could create problems.
.SS HEADER_FILE_ONLY
.sp
Is this source file only a header file.
.sp
A property on a source file that indicates if the source file is a
header file with no associated implementation.  This is set
automatically based on the file extension and is used by CMake to
determine if certain dependency information should be computed.
.sp
By setting this property to \fBON\fP, you can disable compilation of
the given source file, even if it should be compiled because it is
part of the library\(aqs/executable\(aqs sources.
.sp
This is useful if you have some source files which you somehow
pre\-process, and then add these pre\-processed sources via
\fBadd_library()\fP or \fBadd_executable()\fP\&. Normally, in IDE,
there would be no reference of the original sources, only of these
pre\-processed sources. So by setting this property for all the original
source files to \fBON\fP, and then either calling \fBadd_library()\fP
or \fBadd_executable()\fP while passing both the pre\-processed
sources and the original sources, or by using \fBtarget_sources()\fP
to add original source files will do exactly what would one expect, i.e.
the original source files would be visible in IDE, and will not be built.
.SS KEEP_EXTENSION
.sp
Make the output file have the same extension as the source file.
.sp
If this property is set then the file extension of the output file
will be the same as that of the source file.  Normally the output file
extension is computed based on the language of the source file, for
example .cxx will go to a .o extension.
.SS LABELS
.sp
Specify a list of text labels associated with a source file.
.sp
This property has meaning only when the source file is listed in a
target whose LABELS property is also set.  No other semantics are
currently specified.
.SS LANGUAGE
.sp
What programming language is the file.
.sp
A property that can be set to indicate what programming language the
source file is.  If it is not set the language is determined based on
the file extension.  Typical values are CXX C etc.  Setting this
property for a file means this file will be compiled.  Do not set this
for headers or files that should not be compiled.
.SS LOCATION
.sp
The full path to a source file.
.sp
A read only property on a SOURCE FILE that contains the full path to
the source file.
.SS MACOSX_PACKAGE_LOCATION
.sp
Place a source file inside a Application Bundle
(\fBMACOSX_BUNDLE\fP), Core Foundation Bundle (\fBBUNDLE\fP),
or Framework Bundle (\fBFRAMEWORK\fP).  It is applicable for OS X
and iOS.
.sp
Executable targets with the \fBMACOSX_BUNDLE\fP property set are
built as OS X or iOS application bundles on Apple platforms.  Shared
library targets with the \fBFRAMEWORK\fP property set are built as
OS X or iOS frameworks on Apple platforms.  Module library targets with
the \fBBUNDLE\fP property set are built as OS X \fBCFBundle\fP bundles
on Apple platforms.  Source files listed in the target with this property
set will be copied to a directory inside the bundle or framework content
folder specified by the property value.  For OS X Application Bundles the
content folder is \fB<name>.app/Contents\fP\&.  For OS X Frameworks the
content folder is \fB<name>.framework/Versions/<version>\fP\&.  For OS X
CFBundles the content folder is \fB<name>.bundle/Contents\fP (unless the
extension is changed).  See the \fBPUBLIC_HEADER\fP,
\fBPRIVATE_HEADER\fP, and \fBRESOURCE\fP target properties for
specifying files meant for \fBHeaders\fP, \fBPrivateHeaders\fP, or
\fBResources\fP directories.
.sp
If the specified location is equal to \fBResources\fP, the resulting location
will be the same as if the \fBRESOURCE\fP property had been used. If
the specified location is a sub\-folder of \fBResources\fP, it will be placed
into the respective sub\-folder. Note: For iOS Apple uses a flat bundle layout
where no \fBResources\fP folder exist. Therefore CMake strips the \fBResources\fP
folder name from the specified location.
.SS OBJECT_DEPENDS
.sp
Additional files on which a compiled object file depends.
.sp
Specifies a ;\-list of full\-paths to
files on which any object files compiled from this source file depend.
On Makefile Generators and the \fBNinja\fP generator an
object file will be recompiled if any of the named files is newer than it.
Visual Studio Generators and the \fBXcode\fP generator
cannot implement such compilation dependencies.
.sp
This property need not be used to specify the dependency of a source
file on a generated header file that it includes.  Although the
property was originally introduced for this purpose, it is no longer
necessary.  If the generated header file is created by a custom
command in the same target as the source file, the automatic
dependency scanning process will recognize the dependency.  If the
generated header file is created by another target, an inter\-target
dependency should be created with the \fBadd_dependencies()\fP
command (if one does not already exist due to linking relationships).
.SS OBJECT_OUTPUTS
.sp
Additional outputs for a Makefile rule.
.sp
Additional outputs created by compilation of this source file.  If any
of these outputs is missing the object will be recompiled.  This is
supported only on Makefile generators and will be ignored on other
generators.
.SS SKIP_AUTOGEN
.sp
Exclude the source file from \fBAUTOMOC\fP, \fBAUTOUIC\fP and
\fBAUTORCC\fP processing (for Qt projects).
.sp

.SS SYMBOLIC
.sp
Is this just a name for a rule.
.sp
If SYMBOLIC (boolean) is set to true the build system will be informed
that the source file is not actually created on disk but instead used
as a symbolic name for a build rule.
.SS VS_COPY_TO_OUT_DIR
.sp
Sets the \fB<CopyToOutputDirectory>\fP tag for a source file in a
Visual Studio project file. Valid values are \fBNever\fP, \fBAlways\fP
and \fBPreserveNewest\fP\&.
.SS VS_CSHARP_<tagname>
.sp
Visual Studio and CSharp source\-file\-specific configuration.
.sp
Tell the Visual Studio generator to set the source file tag
\fB<tagname>\fP to a given value in the generated Visual Studio CSharp
project. Ignored on other generators and languages. This property
can be used to define dependencies between source files or set any
other Visual Studio specific parameters.

.SS VS_DEPLOYMENT_CONTENT
.sp
Mark a source file as content for deployment with a Windows Phone or
Windows Store application when built with a Visual Studio generator.
The value must evaluate to either \fB1\fP or \fB0\fP and may use
\fBgenerator expressions\fP
to make the choice based on the build configuration.
The \fB\&.vcxproj\fP file entry for the source file will be
marked either \fBDeploymentContent\fP or \fBExcludedFromBuild\fP
for values \fB1\fP and \fB0\fP, respectively.
.SS VS_DEPLOYMENT_LOCATION
.sp
Specifies the deployment location for a content source file with a Windows
Phone or Windows Store application when built with a Visual Studio generator.
This property is only applicable when using \fBVS_DEPLOYMENT_CONTENT\fP\&.
The value represent the path relative to the app package and applies to all
configurations.
.SS VS_INCLUDE_IN_VSIX
.sp
Boolean property to specify if the file should be included within a VSIX
extension package. This is needed for development of Visual Studio
extensions.
.SS VS_RESOURCE_GENERATOR
.sp
This property allows to specify the resource generator to be used
on this file. It defaults to \fBPublicResXFileCodeGenerator\fP if
not set.
.sp
This property only applies to C# projects.
.SS VS_SHADER_ENTRYPOINT
.sp
Specifies the name of the entry point for the shader of a \fB\&.hlsl\fP source
file.
.SS VS_SHADER_FLAGS
.sp
Set additional VS shader flags of a \fB\&.hlsl\fP source file.
.SS VS_SHADER_MODEL

source file.
.SS VS_TOOL_OVERRIDE
.sp
Override the default Visual Studio tool that will be applied to the source file
with a new tool not based on the extension of the file.
.SS VS_XAML_TYPE
.sp
Mark a XAML source file as a different type than the default \fBPage\fP\&.
The most common usage would be to set the default App.xaml file as
ApplicationDefinition.
.SS WRAP_EXCLUDE
.sp
Exclude this source file from any code wrapping techniques.
.sp
Some packages can wrap source files into alternate languages to
provide additional functionality.  For example, C++ code can be
wrapped into Java or Python etc using SWIG etc.  If WRAP_EXCLUDE is
set to true (1 etc) that indicates that this source file should not be
wrapped.
.SS XCODE_EXPLICIT_FILE_TYPE
.sp
Set the Xcode \fBexplicitFileType\fP attribute on its reference to a
source file.  CMake computes a default based on file extension but
can be told explicitly with this property.
.sp
See also \fBXCODE_LAST_KNOWN_FILE_TYPE\fP\&.
.SS XCODE_FILE_ATTRIBUTES
.sp
Add values to the Xcode \fBATTRIBUTES\fP setting on its reference to a
source file.  Among other things, this can be used to set the role on
a mig file:

.sp
See also \fBXCODE_EXPLICIT_FILE_TYPE\fP, which is preferred
over this property if set.
.SH PROPERTIES ON CACHE ENTRIES
.SS ADVANCED
.sp
True if entry should be hidden by default in GUIs.
.sp
This is a boolean value indicating whether the entry is considered
interesting only for advanced configuration.  The mark_as_advanced()
command modifies this property.
.SS HELPSTRING
.sp
Help associated with entry in GUIs.
.sp
This string summarizes the purpose of an entry to help users set it
through a CMake GUI.
.SS MODIFIED
.sp
Internal management property.  Do not set or get.
.sp
This is an internal cache entry property managed by CMake to track
interactive user modification of entries.  Ignore it.
.SS STRINGS
.sp
Enumerate possible STRING entry values for GUI selection.
.sp
For cache entries with type STRING, this enumerates a set of values.
CMake GUIs may use this to provide a selection widget instead of a
generic string entry field.  This is for convenience only.  CMake does
not enforce that the value matches one of those listed.
.SS TYPE
.sp
Widget type for entry in GUIs.
.sp
Cache entry values are always strings, but CMake GUIs present widgets
to help users set values.  The GUIs use this property as a hint to
determine the widget type.  Valid TYPE values are:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
BOOL          = Boolean ON/OFF value.
PATH          = Path to a directory.
FILEPATH      = Path to a file.
STRING        = Generic string value.
INTERNAL      = Do not present in GUI at all.
STATIC        = Value managed by CMake, do not change.
UNINITIALIZED = Type not yet specified.
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Generally the TYPE of a cache entry should be set by the command which
creates it (set, option, find_library, etc.).
.SS VALUE
.sp
Value of a cache entry.
.sp
This property maps to the actual value of a cache entry.  Setting this
property always sets the value without checking, so use with care.
