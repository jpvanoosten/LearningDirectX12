.SH INTRODUCTION
.sp
Policies in CMake are used to preserve backward compatible behavior
across multiple releases.  When a new policy is introduced, newer CMake
versions will begin to warn about the backward compatible behavior.  It
is possible to disable the warning by explicitly requesting the OLD, or
backward compatible behavior using the \fBcmake_policy()\fP command.
It is also possible to request \fBNEW\fP, or non\-backward compatible behavior
for a policy, also avoiding the warning.  Each policy can also be set to
either \fBNEW\fP or \fBOLD\fP behavior explicitly on the command line with the
\fBCMAKE_POLICY_DEFAULT_CMP<NNNN>\fP variable.
.sp
A policy is a deprecation mechanism and not a reliable feature toggle.
A policy should almost never be set to \fBOLD\fP, except to silence warnings
in an otherwise frozen or stable codebase, or temporarily as part of a
larger migration path. The \fBOLD\fP behavior of each policy is undesirable
and will be replaced with an error condition in a future release.
.sp
The \fBcmake_minimum_required()\fP command does more than report an
error if a too\-old version of CMake is used to build a project.  It
also sets all policies introduced in that CMake version or earlier to
\fBNEW\fP behavior.  To manage policies without increasing the minimum required
CMake version, the \fBif(POLICY)\fP command may be used:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
if(POLICY CMP0990)
  cmake_policy(SET CMP0990 NEW)
endif()
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This has the effect of using the \fBNEW\fP behavior with newer CMake releases which
users may be using and not issuing a compatibility warning.
.sp
The setting of a policy is confined in some cases to not propagate to the
parent scope.  For example, if the files read by the \fBinclude()\fP command
or the \fBfind_package()\fP command contain a use of \fBcmake_policy()\fP,
that policy setting will not affect the caller by default.  Both commands accept
an optional \fBNO_POLICY_SCOPE\fP keyword to control this behavior.
.sp
The \fBCMAKE_MINIMUM_REQUIRED_VERSION\fP variable may also be used
to determine whether to report an error on use of deprecated macros or
functions.
.SH POLICIES INTRODUCED BY CMAKE 3.10

.sp
Let \fBAUTOMOC\fP and \fBAUTOUIC\fP process
\fBGENERATED\fP files.
.sp
Since version 3.10, CMake processes \fBregular\fP and \fBGENERATED\fP
source files in \fBAUTOMOC\fP and \fBAUTOUIC\fP\&.
In earlier CMake versions, only \fBregular\fP source files were processed.
\fBGENERATED\fP source files were ignored silently.
.sp
This policy affects how source files that are \fBGENERATED\fP
get treated in \fBAUTOMOC\fP and \fBAUTOUIC\fP\&.
.sp
The \fBOLD\fP behavior for this policy is to ignore \fBGENERATED\fP
source files in \fBAUTOMOC\fP and \fBAUTOUIC\fP\&.

Define \fBfile(GENERATE)\fP behavior for relative paths.
.sp
CMake 3.10 and newer define that relative paths given to \fBINPUT\fP and
\fBOUTPUT\fP arguments of \fBfile(GENERATE)\fP are interpreted relative to the
current source and binary directories, respectively.  CMake 3.9 and lower did
not define any behavior for relative paths but did not diagnose them either
and accidentally treated them relative to the process working directory.
Policy \fBCMP0070\fP provides compatibility with projects that used the old
undefined behavior.

\fBINTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION\fP is enforced when enabled.
.sp
CMake 3.9 and newer prefer to add IPO flags whenever the
\fBINTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION\fP target property is enabled and
produce an error if flags are not known to CMake for the current compiler.
Since a given compiler may not support IPO flags in all environments in which
it is used, it is now the project\(aqs responsibility to use the
\fBCheckIPOSupported\fP module to check for support before enabling the
\fBINTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION\fP target property.  This approach
allows a project to conditionally activate IPO when supported.  It also
allows an end user to set the \fBCMAKE_INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION\fP
variable in an environment known to support IPO even if the project does
not enable the property.
.sp
Since CMake 3.8 and lower only honored \fBINTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION\fP
for the Intel compiler on Linux, some projects may unconditionally enable the
target property.  Policy \fBCMP0069\fP provides compatibility with such projects.
.sp
This policy takes effect whenever the IPO property is enabled.  The \fBOLD\fP
behavior for this policy is to add IPO flags only for Intel compiler on Linux.
The \fBNEW\fP behavior for this policy is to add IPO flags for the current
compiler or produce an error if CMake does not know the flags.
.sp
This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.9.  CMake version

\fBRPATH\fP settings on macOS do not affect \fBinstall_name\fP\&.

CMake 3.9 and newer remove any effect the following settings may have on the
\fBinstall_name\fP of a target on macOS:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBBUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH\fP target property

.IP \(bu 2
\fBCMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_RPATH\fP variable
.UNINDENT
.sp
Previously, setting \fBBUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH\fP had the effect of
setting both the \fBinstall_name\fP of a target to \fBINSTALL_NAME_DIR\fP
and the \fBRPATH\fP to \fBINSTALL_RPATH\fP\&.  In CMake 3.9, it only affects
setting of \fBRPATH\fP\&.  However, if one wants \fBINSTALL_NAME_DIR\fP to
apply to the target in the build tree, one may set
\fBBUILD_WITH_INSTALL_NAME_DIR\fP\&.
.sp
If \fBSKIP_BUILD_RPATH\fP, \fBCMAKE_SKIP_RPATH\fP or
\fBCMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_RPATH\fP were used to strip the directory portion
of the \fBinstall_name\fP of a target, one may set \fBINSTALL_NAME_DIR=""\fP
instead.

Honor language standard in \fBtry_compile()\fP source\-file signature.
.sp
The \fBtry_compile()\fP source file signature is intended to allow
callers to check whether they will be able to compile a given source file
with the current toolchain.  In order to match compiler behavior, any
language standard mode should match.  However, CMake 3.7 and below did not
do this.  CMake 3.8 and above prefer to honor the language standard settings
for \fBC\fP, \fBCXX\fP (C++), and \fBCUDA\fP using the values of the variables:

The source file signature of the \fBtry_compile()\fP command uses the value
of the \fBCMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS\fP variable in the test project so that the
test compilation works as it would in the main project.  However, CMake 3.6 and
below do not also honor config\-specific compiler flags such as those in the

the executables for use by any plugins they may load via \fBdlopen\fP\&.
CMake 3.4 and above prefer to do this only for executables that are

Honor visibility properties for all target types.
.sp
The \fB<LANG>_VISIBILITY_PRESET\fP and
\fBVISIBILITY_INLINES_HIDDEN\fP target properties affect visibility
of symbols during dynamic linking.  When first introduced these properties
affected compilation of sources only in shared libraries, module libraries,
and executables with the \fBENABLE_EXPORTS\fP property set.  This
was sufficient for the basic use cases of shared libraries and executables
with plugins.  However, some sources may be compiled as part of static
libraries or object libraries and then linked into a shared library later.
CMake 3.3 and above prefer to honor these properties for sources compiled
in all target types.  This policy preserves compatibility for projects
expecting the properties to work only for some target types.

Link libraries by full path even in implicit directories.
.sp
Policy \fBCMP0003\fP was introduced with the intention of always
linking library files by full path when a full path is given to the
\fBtarget_link_libraries()\fP command.  However, on some platforms
(e.g. HP\-UX) the compiler front\-end adds alternative library search paths
for the current architecture (e.g. \fB/usr/lib/<arch>\fP has alternatives
to libraries in \fB/usr/lib\fP for the current architecture).
On such platforms the \fBfind_library()\fP may find a library such as
\fB/usr/lib/libfoo.so\fP that does not belong to the current architecture.
.sp
Prior to policy \fBCMP0003\fP projects would still build in such
cases because the incorrect library path would be converted to \fB\-lfoo\fP
on the link line and the linker would find the proper library in the
arch\-specific search path provided by the compiler front\-end implicitly.
At the time we chose to remain compatible with such projects by always
converting library files found in implicit link directories to \fB\-lfoo\fP
flags to ask the linker to search for them.  This approach allowed existing
projects to continue to build while still linking to libraries outside
implicit link directories via full path (such as those in the build tree).
.sp
CMake does allow projects to override this behavior by using an
IMPORTED library target with its
\fBIMPORTED_LOCATION\fP property set to the desired full path to
a library file.  In fact, many Find Modules are learning to provide
Imported Targets instead of just the traditional \fBFoo_LIBRARIES\fP
variable listing library files.  However, this makes the link line
generated for a library found by a Find Module depend on whether it
is linked through an imported target or not, which is inconsistent.
Furthermore, this behavior has been a source of confusion because the
generated link line for a library file depends on its location.  It is
also problematic for projects trying to link statically because flags
like \fB\-Wl,\-Bstatic \-lfoo \-Wl,\-Bdynamic\fP may be used to help the linker
select \fBlibfoo.a\fP instead of \fBlibfoo.so\fP but then leak dynamic linking
to following libraries.  (See the \fBLINK_SEARCH_END_STATIC\fP
target property for a solution typically used for that problem.)
.sp
When the special case for libraries in implicit link directories was first
introduced the list of implicit link directories was simply hard\-coded
(e.g. \fB/lib\fP, \fB/usr/lib\fP, and a few others).  Since that time, CMake
has learned to detect the implicit link directories used by the compiler
front\-end.  If necessary, the \fBfind_library()\fP command could be
taught to use this information to help find libraries of the proper
architecture.
.sp
For these reasons, CMake 3.3 and above prefer to drop the special case
and link libraries by full path even when they are in implicit link
directories.  Policy \fBCMP0060\fP provides compatibility for existing
projects.
.sp
The OLD behavior for this policy is to ask the linker to search for
libraries whose full paths are known to be in implicit link directories.
The NEW behavior for this policy is to link libraries by full path even
if they are in implicit link directories.

When an intermediate file generated during the build is consumed
by an expensive operation or a large tree of dependents, one may
reduce the work needed for an incremental rebuild by updating the
file timestamp only when its content changes.  With this approach
the generation rule must have a separate output file that is always
updated with a new timestamp that is newer than any dependencies of
the rule so that the build tool re\-runs the rule only when the input
changes.  We refer to the separate output file as a rule\(aqs \fIwitness\fP
and the generated file as a rule\(aqs \fIbyproduct\fP\&.
.sp
Byproducts may not be listed as outputs because their timestamps are
allowed to be older than the inputs.  No build tools (like \fBmake\fP)
that existed when CMake was designed have a way to express byproducts.
Therefore CMake versions prior to 3.2 had no way to specify them.
Projects typically left byproducts undeclared in the rules that
generate them.  For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
add_custom_command(
  OUTPUT witness.txt
  COMMAND ${CMAKE_COMMAND} \-E copy_if_different
          ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/input.txt
          byproduct.txt # timestamp may not change
  COMMAND ${CMAKE_COMMAND} \-E touch witness.txt
  DEPENDS ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/input.txt
  )
add_custom_target(Provider DEPENDS witness.txt)
add_custom_command(
  OUTPUT generated.c
  COMMAND expensive\-task \-i byproduct.txt \-o generated.c
  DEPENDS ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/byproduct.txt
  )
add_library(Consumer generated.c)
add_dependencies(Consumer Provider)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This works well for all generators except \fBNinja\fP\&.
The Ninja build tool sees a rule listing \fBbyproduct.txt\fP
as a dependency and no rule listing it as an output.  Ninja then
complains that there is no way to satisfy the dependency and
stops building even though there are order\-only dependencies
that ensure \fBbyproduct.txt\fP will exist before its consumers
need it.  See discussion of this problem in \fI\%Ninja Issue 760\fP
for further details on why Ninja works this way.
.sp
Instead of leaving byproducts undeclared in the rules that generate
them, Ninja expects byproducts to be listed along with other outputs.
Such rules may be marked with a \fBrestat\fP option that tells Ninja
to check the timestamps of outputs after the rules run.  This
prevents byproducts whose timestamps do not change from causing
their dependents to re\-build unnecessarily.
.sp
Since the above approach does not tell CMake what custom command
generates \fBbyproduct.txt\fP, the Ninja generator does not have
enough information to add the byproduct as an output of any rule.
CMake 2.8.12 and above work around this problem and allow projects
using the above approach to build by generating \fBphony\fP build
rules to tell Ninja to tolerate such missing files.  However, this
workaround prevents Ninja from diagnosing a dependency that is
really missing.  It also works poorly in in\-source builds where
every custom command dependency, even on source files, needs to
be treated this way because CMake does not have enough information
to know which files are generated as byproducts of custom commands.
.sp
CMake 3.2 introduced the \fBBYPRODUCTS\fP option to the
\fBadd_custom_command()\fP and \fBadd_custom_target()\fP
commands.  This option allows byproducts to be specified explicitly:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
add_custom_command(
  OUTPUT witness.txt
  BYPRODUCTS byproduct.txt # explicit byproduct specification
  COMMAND ${CMAKE_COMMAND} \-E copy_if_different
          ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/input.txt
          byproduct.txt # timestamp may not change
\&...
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The \fBBYPRODUCTS\fP option is used by the \fBNinja\fP generator
to list byproducts among the outputs of the custom commands that
generate them, and is ignored by other generators.
.sp
CMake 3.3 and above prefer to require projects to specify custom
command byproducts explicitly so that it can avoid using the
\fBphony\fP rule workaround altogether.  Policy \fBCMP0058\fP was
introduced to provide compatibility with existing projects that
still need the workaround.
.sp
This policy has no effect on generators other than \fBNinja\fP\&.
The \fBOLD\fP behavior for this policy is to generate Ninja \fBphony\fP
rules for unknown dependencies in the build tree.  The \fBNEW\fP
behavior for this policy is to not generate these and instead
require projects to specify custom command \fBBYPRODUCTS\fP explicitly.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.3.

Honor link flags in \fBtry_compile()\fP source\-file signature.
.sp
The \fBtry_compile()\fP command source\-file signature generates a
\fBCMakeLists.txt\fP file to build the source file into an executable.
In order to compile the source the same way as it might be compiled
by the calling project, the generated project sets the value of the
\fBCMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS\fP variable to that in the calling project.
The value of the \fBCMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS\fP variable may be
needed in some cases too, but CMake 3.1 and lower did not set it in
the generated project.  CMake 3.2 and above prefer to set it so that
linker flags are honored as well as compiler flags.  This policy
provides compatibility with the pre\-3.2 behavior.
.sp
The OLD behavior for this policy is to not set the value of the
\fBCMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS\fP variable in the generated test

Double colon in target name means ALIAS or IMPORTED target.

CMake 2.8.12 and lower allowed the use of targets and files with double
colons in target_link_libraries, with some buildsystem generators.

The use of double\-colons is a common pattern used to namespace IMPORTED
targets and ALIAS targets.  When computing the link dependencies of a target,
the name of each dependency could either be a target, or a file on disk.

Plain and keyword target_link_libraries signatures cannot be mixed.

CMake 2.8.12 introduced the target_link_libraries signature using the
PUBLIC, PRIVATE, and INTERFACE keywords to generalize the LINK_PUBLIC
and LINK_PRIVATE keywords introduced in CMake 2.8.7.  Use of
signatures with any of these keywords sets the link interface of a
target explicitly, even if empty.  This produces confusing behavior
when used in combination with the historical behavior of the plain
target_link_libraries signature.  For example, consider the code:

INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES defines the link interface.
.sp
CMake 2.8.11 constructed the \(aqlink interface\(aq of a target from
properties matching \fB(IMPORTED_)?LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES(_<CONFIG>)?\fP\&.
The modern way to specify config\-sensitive content is to use generator
expressions and the \fBIMPORTED_\fP prefix makes uniform processing of the
link interface with generator expressions impossible.  The
INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES target property was introduced as a
replacement in CMake 2.8.12.  This new property is named consistently
with the INTERFACE_COMPILE_DEFINITIONS, INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES
and INTERFACE_COMPILE_OPTIONS properties.  For in\-build targets, CMake
will use the INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES property as the source of the
link interface only if policy CMP0022 is NEW.  When exporting a target
which has this policy set to NEW, only the INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES
property will be processed and generated for the IMPORTED target by
default.  A new option to the install(EXPORT) and export commands
allows export of the old\-style properties for compatibility with
downstream users of CMake versions older than 2.8.12.  The
target_link_libraries command will no longer populate the properties
matching LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES(_<CONFIG>)? if this policy is NEW.

Automatically link Qt executables to qtmain target on Windows.

CMake 2.8.11 gained the ability to evaluate generator expressions

allows CMake itself to automatically link executables which link to Qt
to the qtmain.lib library when using IMPORTED Qt targets.  For
applications already linking to qtmain.lib, this should have little
impact.  For applications which supply their own alternative WinMain
implementation and for applications which use the QAxServer library,
this automatic linking will need to be disabled as per the

Prefer files from the CMake module directory when including from there.
.sp
Starting with CMake 2.8.4, if a cmake\-module shipped with CMake (i.e.
located in the CMake module directory) calls include() or
find_package(), the files located in the CMake module directory are
preferred over the files in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH.  This makes sure that
the modules belonging to CMake always get those files included which
they expect, and against which they were developed and tested.  In all
other cases, the files found in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH still take
precedence over the ones in the CMake module directory.  The OLD
behavior is to always prefer files from CMAKE_MODULE_PATH over files
from the CMake modules directory.

if() recognizes numbers and boolean constants.

In CMake versions 2.6.4 and lower the if() command implicitly
dereferenced arguments corresponding to variables, even those named
like numbers or boolean constants, except for 0 and 1.  Numbers and
boolean constants such as true, false, yes, no, on, off, y, n,
notfound, ignore (all case insensitive) were recognized in some cases
but not all.  For example, the code "if(TRUE)" might have evaluated as
false.  Numbers such as 2 were recognized only in boolean expressions
like "if(NOT 2)" (leading to false) but not as a single\-argument like
"if(2)" (also leading to false).  Later versions of CMake prefer to
treat numbers and boolean constants literally, so they should not be
used as variable names.

where "somelib" is supposed to be a valid library file name such as
"libsomelib.a" or "somelib.lib".  For Makefile generators this
produces an error at build time because the dependency on the full
path cannot be found.  For VS IDE and Xcode generators this used to
work by accident because CMake would always split off the library
directory and ask the linker to search for the library by name
(\-lsomelib or somelib.lib).  Despite the failure with Makefiles, some
projects have code like this and build only with VS and/or Xcode.
This version of CMake prefers to pass the full path directly to the

name a valid library file.

Libraries linked via full path no longer produce linker search paths.
.sp
This policy affects how libraries whose full paths are NOT known are
found at link time, but was created due to a change in how CMake deals
with libraries whose full paths are known.  Consider the code
.INDENT 0.0

.sp
.nf
.ft C
target_link_libraries(myexe /path/to/libA.so)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
CMake 2.4 and below implemented linking to libraries whose full paths
are known by splitting them on the link line into separate components
consisting of the linker search path and the library name.  The
example code might have produced something like
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
\&... \-L/path/to \-lA ...
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
in order to link to library A.  An analysis was performed to order
multiple link directories such that the linker would find library A in
the desired location, but there are cases in which this does not work.
CMake versions 2.6 and above use the more reliable approach of passing
the full path to libraries directly to the linker in most cases.  The
example code now produces something like
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
\&... /path/to/libA.so ....
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT

Unfortunately this change can break code like
.INDENT 0.0

.sp
.nf
.ft C
target_link_libraries(myexe /path/to/libA.so B)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
where "B" is meant to find "/path/to/libB.so".  This code is wrong
because the user is asking the linker to find library B but has not
provided a linker search path (which may be added with the
link_directories command).  However, with the old linking
implementation the code would work accidentally because the linker
search path added for library A allowed library B to be found.
.sp
In order to support projects depending on linker search paths added by
linking to libraries with known full paths, the OLD behavior for this
policy will add the linker search paths even though they are not
needed for their own libraries.  When this policy is set to OLD, CMake
will produce a link line such as
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
\&... \-L/path/to /path/to/libA.so \-lB ...
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT

which will allow library B to be found as it was previously.  When
this policy is set to NEW, CMake will produce a link line such as

.nf
.ft C
\&... /path/to/libA.so \-lB ...

which more accurately matches what the project specified.
.sp
The setting for this policy used when generating the link line is that
in effect when the target is created by an add_executable or
add_library command.  For the example described above, the code
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
cmake_policy(SET CMP0003 OLD) # or cmake_policy(VERSION 2.4)
add_executable(myexe myexe.c)
target_link_libraries(myexe /path/to/libA.so B)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT

will work and suppress the warning for this policy.  It may also be
updated to work with the corrected linking approach:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

.nf
.ft C
cmake_policy(SET CMP0003 NEW) # or cmake_policy(VERSION 2.6)
link_directories(/path/to) # needed to find library B
add_executable(myexe myexe.c)
target_link_libraries(myexe /path/to/libA.so B)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT

Even better, library B may be specified with a full path:
.INDENT 0.0

target_link_libraries(myexe /path/to/libA.so /path/to/libB.so)

A minimum required CMake version must be specified.
.sp
CMake requires that projects specify the version of CMake to which
they have been written.  This policy has been put in place so users
trying to build the project may be told when they need to update their
CMake.  Specifying a version also helps the project build with CMake
versions newer than that specified.  Use the cmake_minimum_required
command at the top of your main CMakeLists.txt file:

Note that the command invocation must appear in the CMakeLists.txt
