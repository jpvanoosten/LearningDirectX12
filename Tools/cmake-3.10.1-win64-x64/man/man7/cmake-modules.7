ADD_FILE_DEPENDENCIES(source_file depend_files...)
.sp
Adds the given files as dependencies to source_file
.SS AndroidTestUtilities
.sp
Create a test that automatically loads specified data onto an Android device.
.SS Introduction
.sp
Use this module to push data needed for testing an Android device behavior
onto a connected Android device. The module will accept files and libraries as
well as separate destinations for each. It will create a test that loads the
files into a device object store and link to them from the specified
destination. The files are only uploaded if they are not already in the object
store.
.sp
For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
include(AndroidTestUtilities)
android_add_test_data(
  example_setup_test
  FILES <files>...
  LIBS <libs>...
  DEVICE_TEST_DIR "/data/local/tests/example"
  DEVICE_OBJECT_STORE "/sdcard/.ExternalData/SHA"
  )
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
At build time a test named "example_setup_test" will be created.  Run this test
on the command line with \fBctest(1)\fP to load the data onto the Android
device.

The \fBandroid_add_test_data\fP function is used to copy files and libraries
needed to run project\-specific tests. On the host operating system, this is
done at build time. For on\-device testing, the files are loaded onto the
device by the manufactured test at run time.
.sp
This function accepts the following named parameters:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fBFILES <files>...\fP
zero or more files needed for testing
.TP
.B \fBLIBS <libs>...\fP
zero or more libraries needed for testing

.ft C
FIXUP_BUNDLE(<app> <libs> <dirs>)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Fix up a bundle in\-place and make it standalone, such that it can be
drag\-n\-drop copied to another machine and run on that machine as long
as all of the system libraries are compatible.
.sp
If you pass plugins to fixup_bundle as the libs parameter, you should
install them or copy them into the bundle before calling fixup_bundle.
The "libs" parameter is a list of libraries that must be fixed up, but
that cannot be determined by otool output analysis.  (i.e., plugins)
.sp
Gather all the keys for all the executables and libraries in a bundle,
and then, for each key, copy each prerequisite into the bundle.  Then
fix each one up according to its own list of prerequisites.
.sp
Then clear all the keys and call verify_app on the final bundle to
ensure that it is truly standalone.
.sp
As an optional parameter (IGNORE_ITEM) a list of file names can be passed,
which are then ignored (e.g. IGNORE_ITEM "vcredist_x86.exe;vcredist_x64.exe")

.sp
Given a file (item) name, generate a key that should be unique
considering the set of libraries that need copying or fixing up to
make a bundle standalone.  This is essentially the file name including
extension with "." replaced by "_"
.sp
This key is used as a prefix for CMake variables so that we can
associate a set of variables with a given item based on its key.

.UNINDENT
.sp
Loop over all the executable and library files within the bundle (and
given as extra <libs>) and accumulate a list of keys representing
them.  Set values associated with each key such that we can loop over
all of them and copy prerequisite libs into the bundle and then do
appropriate install_name_tool fixups.
.sp
As an optional parameter (IGNORE_ITEM) a list of file names can be passed,
which are then ignored (e.g. IGNORE_ITEM "vcredist_x86.exe;vcredist_x64.exe")

Copy a resolved item into the bundle if necessary.  Copy is not
necessary if the resolved_item is "the same as" the
resolved_embedded_item.

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Copy a resolved framework into the bundle if necessary.  Copy is not
necessary if the resolved_item is "the same as" the
resolved_embedded_item.
.sp
By default, BU_COPY_FULL_FRAMEWORK_CONTENTS is not set.  If you want
full frameworks embedded in your bundles, set
BU_COPY_FULL_FRAMEWORK_CONTENTS to ON before calling fixup_bundle.  By
default, COPY_RESOLVED_FRAMEWORK_INTO_BUNDLE copies the framework
dylib itself plus the framework Resources directory.

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Get the direct/non\-system prerequisites of the resolved embedded item.
For each prerequisite, change the way it is referenced to the value of
the _EMBEDDED_ITEM keyed variable for that prerequisite.  (Most likely
changing to an "@executable_path" style reference.)
.sp
This function requires that the resolved_embedded_item be "inside" the
bundle already.  In other words, if you pass plugins to fixup_bundle
as the libs parameter, you should install them or copy them into the
bundle before calling fixup_bundle.  The "libs" parameter is a list of
libraries that must be fixed up, but that cannot be determined by
otool output analysis.  (i.e., plugins)
.sp
Also, change the id of the item being fixed up to its own
_EMBEDDED_ITEM value.
.sp
Accumulate changes in a local variable and make \fIone\fP call to
install_name_tool at the end of the function with all the changes at
once.
.sp
If the BU_CHMOD_BUNDLE_ITEMS variable is set then bundle items will be
marked writable before install_name_tool tries to change them.

Verifies that the sum of all prerequisites of all files inside the
bundle are contained within the bundle or are "system" libraries,
presumed to exist everywhere.
.sp
As an optional parameter (IGNORE_ITEM) a list of file names can be passed,
which are then ignored (e.g. IGNORE_ITEM "vcredist_x86.exe;vcredist_x64.exe")

named \fB<var>\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.sp
This command temporarily sets the \fBCMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS\fP variable
and calls the \fBcheck_c_source_compiles\fP macro from the
\fBCheckCSourceCompiles\fP module.  See documentation of that
module for a listing of variables that can otherwise modify the build.

Check that the <symbol> is available after including given header
<files> and store the result in a <variable>.  Specify the list of
files in one argument as a semicolon\-separated list.
CHECK_CXX_SYMBOL_EXISTS() can be used to check in C++ files, as
opposed to CHECK_SYMBOL_EXISTS(), which works only for C.
.sp
If the header files define the symbol as a macro it is considered
available and assumed to work.  If the header files declare the symbol
as a function or variable then the symbol must also be available for
linking.  If the symbol is a type or enum value it will not be
recognized (consider using CheckTypeSize or CheckCSourceCompiles).

Check that the source supplied in \fBcode\fP can be compiled as a Fortran

\fBPROGRAM\fP entry point). The result will be stored in the internal cache
variable specified by \fBresultVar\fP, with a boolean true value for success

determined by checking if anything in the output matches any of the specified

By default, the test source file will be given a \fB\&.F\fP file extension. The
\fBSRC_EXT\fP option can be used to override this with \fB\&.ext\fP instead.

The underlying check is performed by the \fBtry_compile()\fP command. The

.B \fBCMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS\fP
Additional flags to pass to the compiler. Note that the contents of
\fBCMAKE_Fortran_FLAGS\fP and its associated
configuration\-specific variable are automatically added to the compiler

A ;\-list of header search paths to pass to

The check is only performed once, with the result cached in the variable
named by \fBresultVar\fP\&. Every subsequent CMake run will re\-use this cached

Both \fBHAVE_${VARIABLE}\fP and \fB${VARIABLE}\fP will be created as internal

Furthermore, the variable "${VARIABLE}_CODE" holds C preprocessor code
to define the macro "${VARIABLE}" to the size of the type, or leave
the macro undefined if the type does not exist.
.sp
The variable "${VARIABLE}" may be "0" when CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES has
multiple architectures for building OS X universal binaries.  This
indicates that the type size varies across architectures.  In this
case "${VARIABLE}_CODE" contains C preprocessor tests mapping from
each architecture macro to the corresponding type size.  The list of
architecture macros is stored in "${VARIABLE}_KEYS", and the value for
each key is stored in "${VARIABLE}\-${KEY}".
.sp
If the BUILTIN_TYPES_ONLY option is not given, the macro checks for
headers <sys/types.h>, <stdint.h>, and <stddef.h>, and saves results
in HAVE_SYS_TYPES_H, HAVE_STDINT_H, and HAVE_STDDEF_H.  The type size
check automatically includes the available headers, thus supporting
checks of types defined in the headers.

check. Acceptable values are C and CXX

Use MinGW gfortran from VS if a fortran compiler is not found.
.sp
The \(aqadd_fortran_subdirectory\(aq function adds a subdirectory to a
project that contains a fortran only sub\-project.  The module will
check the current compiler and see if it can support fortran.  If no
fortran compiler is found and the compiler is MSVC, then this module
will find the MinGW gfortran.  It will then use an external project to
build with the MinGW tools.  It will also create imported targets for
the libraries created.  This will only work if the fortran code is
built into a dll, so BUILD_SHARED_LIBS is turned on in the project.
In addition the CMAKE_GNUtoMS option is set to on, so that the MS .lib
files are created.  Usage is as follows:

conditions are true.  When the option is not presented a default value
is used, but any value set by the user is preserved for when the
option is presented again.  Example invocation:

.INDENT 3.5
.sp

.ft P

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If USE_BAR is true and USE_ZOT is false, this provides an option
called USE_FOO that defaults to ON.  Otherwise, it sets USE_FOO to
OFF.  If the status of USE_BAR or USE_ZOT ever changes, any value for
the USE_FOO option is saved so that when the option is re\-enabled it
retains its old value.

The macros provided by this module were once intended for use by
cross\-compiling toolchain files when CMake was not able to automatically
detect the compiler identification.  Since the introduction of this module,
CMake\(aqs compiler identification capabilities have improved and can now be
taught to recognize any compiler.  Furthermore, the suite of information
CMake detects from a compiler is now too extensive to be provided by
toolchain files using these macros.
.sp
One common use case for this module was to skip CMake\(aqs checks for a
working compiler when using a cross\-compiler that cannot link binaries
without special flags or custom linker scripts.  This case is now supported
by setting the \fBCMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_TARGET_TYPE\fP variable in the
toolchain file instead.

CMake
can generate \fI\%graphviz\fP files, showing the dependencies between the
targets in a project and also external libraries which are linked
against.  When CMake is run with the \fB\-\-graphviz=foo.dot\fP option, it will
produce:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
a \fBfoo.dot\fP file showing all dependencies in the project
.IP \(bu 2
a \fBfoo.dot.<target>\fP file for each target, file showing on which other targets the respective target depends
.IP \(bu 2

\fBconfigure_package_config_file()\fP should be used instead of the plain
\fBconfigure_file()\fP command when creating the \fB<Name>Config.cmake\fP
or \fB<Name>\-config.cmake\fP file for installing a project or library.  It helps
making the resulting package relocatable by avoiding hardcoded paths in the
installed \fBConfig.cmake\fP file.
.sp
In a \fBFooConfig.cmake\fP file there may be code like this to make the install
destinations know to the using project:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
set(FOO_INCLUDE_DIR   "@CMAKE_INSTALL_FULL_INCLUDEDIR@" )
set(FOO_DATA_DIR   "@CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX@/@RELATIVE_DATA_INSTALL_DIR@" )
set(FOO_ICONS_DIR   "@CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX@/share/icons" )
#...logic to determine installedPrefix from the own location...
set(FOO_CONFIG_DIR  "${installedPrefix}/@CONFIG_INSTALL_DIR@" )
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
All 4 options shown above are not sufficient, since the first 3 hardcode the
absolute directory locations, and the 4th case works only if the logic to
determine the \fBinstalledPrefix\fP is correct, and if \fBCONFIG_INSTALL_DIR\fP
contains a relative path, which in general cannot be guaranteed.  This has the
effect that the resulting \fBFooConfig.cmake\fP file would work poorly under
Windows and OSX, where users are used to choose the install location of a
binary package at install time, independent from how
\fBCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX\fP was set at build/cmake time.
.sp
Using \fBconfigure_package_config_file\fP helps.  If used correctly, it makes
the resulting \fBFooConfig.cmake\fP file relocatable.  Usage:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
write a \fBFooConfig.cmake.in\fP file as you are used to
.IP 2. 3
insert a line containing only the string \fB@PACKAGE_INIT@\fP
.IP 3. 3
instead of \fBset(FOO_DIR "@SOME_INSTALL_DIR@")\fP, use
\fBset(FOO_DIR "@PACKAGE_SOME_INSTALL_DIR@")\fP (this must be after the
\fB@PACKAGE_INIT@\fP line)
.IP 4. 3
instead of using the normal \fBconfigure_file()\fP, use
\fBconfigure_package_config_file()\fP
.UNINDENT
.sp
The \fB<input>\fP and \fB<output>\fP arguments are the input and output file, the
same way as in \fBconfigure_file()\fP\&.
.sp
The \fB<path>\fP given to \fBINSTALL_DESTINATION\fP must be the destination where
the \fBFooConfig.cmake\fP file will be installed to.  This path can either be
absolute, or relative to the \fBINSTALL_PREFIX\fP path.
.sp
The variables \fB<var1>\fP to \fB<varN>\fP given as \fBPATH_VARS\fP are the
variables which contain install destinations.  For each of them the macro will
create a helper variable \fBPACKAGE_<var...>\fP\&.  These helper variables must be
used in the \fBFooConfig.cmake.in\fP file for setting the installed location.
They are calculated by \fBconfigure_package_config_file\fP so that they are
always relative to the installed location of the package.  This works both for
relative and also for absolute locations.  For absolute locations it works
only if the absolute location is a subdirectory of \fBINSTALL_PREFIX\fP\&.
.sp
If the \fBINSTALL_PREFIX\fP argument is passed, this is used as base path to
calculate all the relative paths.  The \fB<path>\fP argument must be an absolute
path.  If this argument is not passed, the \fBCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX\fP
variable will be used instead.  The default value is good when generating a
FooConfig.cmake file to use your package from the install tree.  When
generating a FooConfig.cmake file to use your package from the build tree this
option should be used.
.sp
By default \fBconfigure_package_config_file\fP also generates two helper macros,
\fBset_and_check()\fP and \fBcheck_required_components()\fP into the
\fBFooConfig.cmake\fP file.
.sp
\fBset_and_check()\fP should be used instead of the normal \fBset()\fP command for
setting directories and file locations.  Additionally to setting the variable
it also checks that the referenced file or directory actually exists and fails
with a \fBFATAL_ERROR\fP otherwise.  This makes sure that the created
\fBFooConfig.cmake\fP file does not contain wrong references.
When using the \fBNO_SET_AND_CHECK_MACRO\fP, this macro is not generated
into the \fBFooConfig.cmake\fP file.
.sp
\fBcheck_required_components(<package_name>)\fP should be called at the end of
the \fBFooConfig.cmake\fP file if the package supports components.  This macro
checks whether all requested, non\-optional components have been found, and if
this is not the case, sets the \fBFoo_FOUND\fP variable to \fBFALSE\fP, so that
the package is considered to be not found.  It does that by testing the
\fBFoo_<Component>_FOUND\fP variables for all requested required components.
When using the \fBNO_CHECK_REQUIRED_COMPONENTS_MACRO\fP option, this macro is
not generated into the \fBFooConfig.cmake\fP file.
.sp

\fI\%write_basic_package_version_file()\fP\&.

\fB<filename>\fP is the output filename, it should be in the build tree.
\fB<major.minor.patch>\fP is the version number of the project to be installed.
.sp
If no \fBVERSION\fP is given, the \fBPROJECT_VERSION\fP variable is used.
If this hasn\(aqt been set, it errors out.
.sp
The \fBCOMPATIBILITY\fP mode \fBAnyNewerVersion\fP means that the installed
package version will be considered compatible if it is newer or exactly the
same as the requested version.  This mode should be used for packages which
are fully backward compatible, also across major versions.
If \fBSameMajorVersion\fP is used instead, then the behaviour differs from
\fBAnyNewerVersion\fP in that the major version number must be the same as
requested, e.g.  version 2.0 will not be considered compatible if 1.0 is
requested.  This mode should be used for packages which guarantee backward
compatibility within the same major version.
If \fBExactVersion\fP is used, then the package is only considered compatible if
the requested version matches exactly its own version number (not considering
the tweak version).  For example, version 1.2.3 of a package is only
considered compatible to requested version 1.2.3.  This mode is for packages
without compatibility guarantees.
If your project has more elaborated version matching rules, you will need to
write your own custom \fBConfigVersion.cmake\fP file instead of using this
macro.
.sp
Internally, this macro executes \fBconfigure_file()\fP to create the
resulting version file.  Depending on the \fBCOMPATIBLITY\fP, either the file
\fBBasicConfigVersion\-SameMajorVersion.cmake.in\fP or
\fBBasicConfigVersion\-AnyNewerVersion.cmake.in\fP is used.  Please note that
these two files are internal to CMake and you should not call
\fBconfigure_file()\fP on them yourself, but they can be used as starting
point to create more sophisticted custom \fBConfigVersion.cmake\fP files.

and run the script with cmake \-P.  On the command line you can pass in
versions that are OK even if not found in the .manifest files.  For
example, cmake \-Dallow_versions=8.0.50608.0
\-PCmakeVerifyManifest.cmake could be used to allow an embedded manifest

.SS Variables concerning CPack Components
.sp
The CPackComponent module is the module which handles the component
part of CPack.  See CPack module for general information about CPack.
.sp
For certain kinds of binary installers (including the graphical
installers on Mac OS X and Windows), CPack generates installers that
allow users to select individual application components to install.
The contents of each of the components are identified by the COMPONENT
argument of CMake\(aqs INSTALL command.  These components can be
annotated with user\-friendly names and descriptions, inter\-component
dependencies, etc., and grouped in various ways to customize the
resulting installer.  See the cpack_add_* commands, described below,
for more information about component\-specific installations.
.sp
Component\-specific installation allows users to select specific sets
of components to install during the install process.  Installation
components are identified by the COMPONENT argument of CMake\(aqs INSTALL
commands, and should be further described by the following CPack
commands:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B CPACK_COMPONENTS_ALL
The list of component to install.
.sp
The default value of this variable is computed by CPack and contains all
components defined by the project.  The user may set it to only include the
specified components.
.sp
Instead of specifying all the desired components, it is possible to obtain a
list of all defined components and then remove the unwanted ones from the
list. The \fBget_cmake_property()\fP command can be used to obtain the
\fBCOMPONENTS\fP property, then the \fBlist(REMOVE_ITEM)\fP command can be
used to remove the unwanted ones. For example, to use all defined components
except \fBfoo\fP and \fBbar\fP:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5

.nf
.ft C
get_cmake_property(CPACK_COMPONENTS_ALL COMPONENTS)

.TP
.B CPACK_<GENNAME>_COMPONENT_INSTALL
Enable/Disable component install for CPack generator <GENNAME>.
.sp
Each CPack Generator (RPM, DEB, ARCHIVE, NSIS, DMG, etc...) has a legacy
default behavior.  e.g.  RPM builds monolithic whereas NSIS builds
component.  One can change the default behavior by setting this variable to
0/1 or OFF/ON.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B CPACK_COMPONENTS_GROUPING
Specify how components are grouped for multi\-package component\-aware CPack
generators.
.sp
Some generators like RPM or ARCHIVE family (TGZ, ZIP, ...) generates
several packages files when asked for component packaging.  They group
the component differently depending on the value of this variable:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
ONE_PER_GROUP (default): creates one package file per component group
.IP \(bu 2
ALL_COMPONENTS_IN_ONE : creates a single package with all (requested) component
.IP \(bu 2
IGNORE : creates one package per component, i.e. IGNORE component group

The cmake_add_component command describes an installation component,
which the user can opt to install or remove as part of the graphical
installation process.  compname is the name of the component, as
provided to the COMPONENT argument of one or more CMake INSTALL
commands.
.sp
DISPLAY_NAME is the displayed name of the component, used in graphical
installers to display the component name.  This value can be any
string.
.sp
DESCRIPTION is an extended description of the component, used in
graphical installers to give the user additional information about the
component.  Descriptions can span multiple lines using \fB\en\fP as the
line separator.  Typically, these descriptions should be no more than
a few lines long.
.sp
HIDDEN indicates that this component will be hidden in the graphical
installer, so that the user cannot directly change whether it is
installed or not.
.sp
REQUIRED indicates that this component is required, and therefore will
always be installed.  It will be visible in the graphical installer,
but it cannot be unselected.  (Typically, required components are
shown greyed out).
.sp
DISABLED indicates that this component should be disabled (unselected)
by default.  The user is free to select this component for
installation, unless it is also HIDDEN.
.sp
DEPENDS lists the components on which this component depends.  If this
component is selected, then each of the components listed must also be
selected.  The dependency information is encoded within the installer
itself, so that users cannot install inconsistent sets of components.
.sp
GROUP names the component group of which this component is a part.  If
not provided, the component will be a standalone component, not part
of any component group.  Component groups are described with the
cpack_add_component_group command, detailed below.
.sp
INSTALL_TYPES lists the installation types of which this component is
a part.  When one of these installations types is selected, this
component will automatically be selected.  Installation types are
described with the cpack_add_install_type command, detailed below.
.sp
DOWNLOADED indicates that this component should be downloaded
on\-the\-fly by the installer, rather than packaged in with the
installer itself.  For more information, see the
cpack_configure_downloads command.
.sp
ARCHIVE_FILE provides a name for the archive file created by CPack to
be used for downloaded components.  If not supplied, CPack will create
a file with some name based on CPACK_PACKAGE_FILE_NAME and the name of
the component.  See cpack_configure_downloads for more information.

The cpack_add_component_group describes a group of installation
components, which will be placed together within the listing of
options.  Typically, component groups allow the user to
select/deselect all of the components within a single group via a
single group\-level option.  Use component groups to reduce the
complexity of installers with many options.  groupname is an arbitrary
name used to identify the group in the GROUP argument of the
cpack_add_component command, which is used to place a component in a
group.  The name of the group must not conflict with the name of any
component.
.sp
DISPLAY_NAME is the displayed name of the component group, used in
graphical installers to display the component group name.  This value
can be any string.

The cpack_configure_downloads command configures installation\-time
downloads of selected components.  For each downloadable component,
CPack will create an archive containing the contents of that
component, which should be uploaded to the given site.  When the user
selects that component for installation, the installer will download
and extract the component in place.  This feature is useful for
creating small installers that only download the requested components,
saving bandwidth.  Additionally, the installers are small enough that
they will be installed as part of the normal installation process, and
the "Change" button in Windows Add/Remove Programs control panel will
allow one to add or remove parts of the application after the original
installation.  On Windows, the downloaded\-components functionality
requires the ZipDLL plug\-in for NSIS, available at:

On Mac OS X, installers that download components on\-the\-fly can only
be built and installed on system using Mac OS X 10.5 or later.
.sp
The site argument is a URL where the archives for downloadable
components will reside, e.g.,
\fI\%https://cmake.org/files/2.6.1/installer/\fP All of the archives
produced by CPack should be uploaded to that location.
.sp
UPLOAD_DIRECTORY is the local directory where CPack will create the
various archives for each of the components.  The contents of this
directory should be uploaded to a location accessible by the URL given
in the site argument.  If omitted, CPack will use the directory
CPackUploads inside the CMake binary directory to store the generated
archives.
.sp
The ALL flag indicates that all components be downloaded.  Otherwise,
only those components explicitly marked as DOWNLOADED or that have a
specified ARCHIVE_FILE will be downloaded.  Additionally, the ALL
option implies ADD_REMOVE (unless NO_ADD_REMOVE is specified).
.sp
ADD_REMOVE indicates that CPack should install a copy of the installer
that can be called from Windows\(aq Add/Remove Programs dialog (via the
"Modify" button) to change the set of installed components.
NO_ADD_REMOVE turns off this behavior.  This option is ignored on Mac
OS X.

.SS CPackFreeBSD
.sp
The built in (binary) CPack FreeBSD (pkg) generator (Unix only)
.SS Variables specific to CPack FreeBSD (pkg) generator
.sp
CPackFreeBSD may be used to create pkg(8) packages \-\- these may be used
on FreeBSD, DragonflyBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, but also on Linux or OSX,
depending on the installed package\-management tools \-\- using \fBCPack\fP\&.
.sp
CPackFreeBSD is a \fBCPack\fP generator and uses the \fBCPACK_XXX\fP
variables used by \fBCPack\fP\&. It tries to re\-use packaging information
that may already be specified for Debian packages for the \fBCPackDeb\fP
generator. it also tries to re\-use RPM packaging information when Debian
does not specify.
.sp
CPackFreeBSD generator should work on any host with libpkg installed. The
packages it produces are specific to the host architecture and ABI.
.sp
CPackFreeBSD sets package\-metadata through \fBCPACK_FREEBSD_XXX\fP variables.
CPackFreeBSD, unlike CPackDeb, does not specially support componentized
packages; a single package is created from all the software artifacts
created through CMake.
.sp
All of the variables can be set specifically for FreeBSD packaging in
the CPackConfig file or in CMakeLists.txt, but most of them have defaults
that use general settings (e.g. CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME) or Debian\-specific
variables when those make sense (e.g. the homepage of an upstream project
is usually unchanged by the flavor of packaging). When there is no Debian
information to fall back on, but the RPM packaging has it, fall back to
the RPM information (e.g. package license).

.SS CPackIFW
.sp
This module looks for the location of the command line utilities supplied
with the Qt Installer Framework (\fI\%QtIFW\fP).
.sp
The module also defines several commands to control the behavior of the
CPack \fBIFW\fP generator.
.SS Overview
.sp
CPack \fBIFW\fP generator helps you to create online and offline
binary cross\-platform installers with a graphical user interface.
.sp
CPack IFW generator prepares project installation and generates configuration
and meta information for \fI\%QtIFW\fP tools.
.sp
The \fI\%QtIFW\fP provides a set of tools and utilities to create
installers for the supported desktop Qt platforms: Linux, Microsoft Windows,
and Mac OS X.
.sp
You should also install \fI\%QtIFW\fP to use CPack \fBIFW\fP generator.
.SS Hints
.sp
Generally, the CPack \fBIFW\fP generator automatically finds \fI\%QtIFW\fP tools,
but if you don\(aqt use a default path for installation of the \fI\%QtIFW\fP tools,
the path may be specified in either a CMake or an environment variable:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B CPACK_IFW_ROOT
An CMake variable which specifies the location of the \fI\%QtIFW\fP tool suite.
.sp
The variable will be cached in the \fBCPackConfig.cmake\fP file and used at
CPack runtime.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B QTIFWDIR
An environment variable which specifies the location of the \fI\%QtIFW\fP tool
suite.
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The specified path should not contain "bin" at the end
(for example: "D:\eDevTools\eQtIFW2.0.5").
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The \fI\%CPACK_IFW_ROOT\fP variable has a higher priority and overrides
the value of the \fI\%QTIFWDIR\fP variable.
.SS Internationalization
.sp
Some variables and command arguments support internationalization via
CMake script. This is an optional feature.
.sp
Installers created by \fI\%QtIFW\fP tools have built\-in support for
internationalization and many phrases are localized to many languages,
but this does not apply to the description of the your components and groups
that will be distributed.
.sp
Localization of the description of your components and groups is useful for
users of your installers.
.sp
A localized variable or argument can contain a single default value, and a
set of pairs the name of the locale and the localized value.
.sp
For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
set(LOCALIZABLE_VARIABLE "Default value"
  en "English value"
  en_US "American value"
  en_GB "Great Britain value"

.SS Online installer
.sp
By default CPack IFW generator makes offline installer. This means that all
components will be packaged into a binary file.
.sp
To make a component downloaded, you must set the \fBDOWNLOADED\fP option in
\fBcpack_add_component()\fP\&.
.sp
Then you would use the command \fBcpack_configure_downloads()\fP\&.
If you set \fBALL\fP option all components will be downloaded.
.sp
You also can use command \fI\%cpack_ifw_add_repository()\fP and
variable \fI\%CPACK_IFW_DOWNLOAD_ALL\fP for more specific configuration.
.sp
CPack IFW generator creates "repository" dir in current binary dir. You
would copy content of this dir to specified \fBsite\fP (\fBurl\fP).

.TP
.B CPACK_OSX_PACKAGE_VERSION
The version of Mac OS X that the resulting PackageMaker archive should be
compatible with. Different versions of Mac OS X support different
features. For example, CPack can only build component\-based installers for
Mac OS X 10.4 or newer, and can only build installers that download
component son\-the\-fly for Mac OS X 10.5 or newer. If left blank, this value
will be set to the minimum version of Mac OS X that supports the requested
features. Set this variable to some value (e.g., 10.4) only if you want to
guarantee that your installer will work on that version of Mac OS X, and
don\(aqt mind missing extra features available in the installer shipping with
later versions of Mac OS X.

.SS Variables specific to CPack RPM generator
.sp
CPackRPM may be used to create RPM packages using \fBCPack\fP\&.
CPackRPM is a \fBCPack\fP generator thus it uses the \fBCPACK_XXX\fP
variables used by \fBCPack\fP\&.
.sp
CPackRPM has specific features which are controlled by the specifics
\fBCPACK_RPM_XXX\fP variables.
.sp
\fBCPACK_RPM_<COMPONENT>_XXXX\fP variables may be used in order to have
\fBcomponent\fP specific values.  Note however that \fB<COMPONENT>\fP refers to the
\fBgrouping name\fP written in upper case. It may be either a component name or
a component GROUP name. Usually those variables correspond to RPM spec file
entities. One may find information about spec files here
\fI\%http://www.rpm.org/wiki/Docs\fP
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fI<COMPONENT>\fP part of variables is preferred to be in upper case (for e.g. if
component is named \fIfoo\fP then use \fICPACK_RPM_FOO_XXXX\fP variable name format)
as is with other \fICPACK_<COMPONENT>_XXXX\fP variables.
For the purposes of back compatibility (CMake/CPack version 3.5 and lower)
support for same cased component (e.g. \fIfOo\fP would be used as
\fICPACK_RPM_fOo_XXXX\fP) is still supported for variables defined in older
versions of CMake/CPack but is not guaranteed for variables that
will be added in the future. For the sake of back compatibility same cased
component variables also override upper cased versions where both are
present.

package (either a different component or even not packaged at all) but
those locations will be treated as if they were a part of the package
while determining if symlink should be either created or present in a
post install script \- depending on relocation paths.

symbolic links will not be handled differently \- if the intermediate
symbolic link(s) is also on a relocatable path, relocating it during

\fBNOTE:\fP

Produced SRPM package is expected to be built with \fBcmake(1)\fP executable

located in root source directory and must be able to generate binary rpm
packages by executing \fBcpack \-G\fP command. The two executables as well as
rpmbuild must also be present when generating binary rpm packages from the
produced SRPM package.
.UNINDENT

by creating a directory structure for rpm generation and executing rpmbuild
tool:

\fBrpmbuild \-\-define "_topdir <path_to_build_dir>" \-\-rebuild <SRPM_file_name>\fP

SRPM package internally uses CPack/RPM generator to generate binary packages
so CMakeScripts.txt can decide during the SRPM to binary rpm generation step
what content the package(s) should have as well as how they should be packaged
(monolithic or components). CMake can decide this for e.g. by reading environment
variables set by the package manager before starting the process of generating
binary rpm packages. This way a single SRPM package can be used to produce
different binary rpm packages on different platforms depending on the platform\(aqs
packaging rules.

.SS CPack
.sp
Build binary and source package installers.
.SS Variables common to all CPack generators
.sp
The
CPack module generates binary and source installers in a variety of
formats using the cpack program.  Inclusion of the CPack module adds
two new targets to the resulting makefiles, package and
package_source, which build the binary and source installers,
respectively.  The generated binary installers contain everything
installed via CMake\(aqs INSTALL command (and the deprecated
INSTALL_FILES, INSTALL_PROGRAMS, and INSTALL_TARGETS commands).
.sp
For certain kinds of binary installers (including the graphical
installers on Mac OS X and Windows), CPack generates installers that
allow users to select individual application components to install.
See CPackComponent module for that.
.sp
The CPACK_GENERATOR variable has different meanings in different
contexts.  In your CMakeLists.txt file, CPACK_GENERATOR is a \fIlist of
generators\fP: when run with no other arguments, CPack will iterate over
that list and produce one package for each generator.  In a
CPACK_PROJECT_CONFIG_FILE, though, CPACK_GENERATOR is a \fIstring naming
a single generator\fP\&.  If you need per\-cpack\- generator logic to
control \fIother\fP cpack settings, then you need a
CPACK_PROJECT_CONFIG_FILE.
.sp
The CMake source tree itself contains a CPACK_PROJECT_CONFIG_FILE.
See the top level file CMakeCPackOptions.cmake.in for an example.
.sp
If set, the CPACK_PROJECT_CONFIG_FILE is included automatically on a
per\-generator basis.  It only need contain overrides.
.sp
Here\(aqs how it works:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
cpack runs
.IP \(bu 2
it includes CPackConfig.cmake
.IP \(bu 2
it iterates over the generators listed in that file\(aqs
CPACK_GENERATOR list variable (unless told to use just a
specific one via \-G on the command line...)
.IP \(bu 2
foreach generator, it then
.INDENT 2.0
.IP \(bu 2
sets CPACK_GENERATOR to the one currently being iterated
.IP \(bu 2
includes the CPACK_PROJECT_CONFIG_FILE
.IP \(bu 2
produces the package for that generator
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This is the key: For each generator listed in CPACK_GENERATOR in
CPackConfig.cmake, cpack will \fIreset\fP CPACK_GENERATOR internally to
\fIthe one currently being used\fP and then include the
CPACK_PROJECT_CONFIG_FILE.
.sp
Before including this CPack module in your CMakeLists.txt file, there
are a variety of variables that can be set to customize the resulting
installers.  The most commonly\-used variables are:
.INDENT 0.0

.SS CTestScriptMode
.sp
This file is read by ctest in script mode (\-S)
.SS CTestUseLaunchers
.sp
Set the RULE_LAUNCH_* global properties when CTEST_USE_LAUNCHERS is on.
.sp
CTestUseLaunchers is automatically included when you include(CTest).
However, it is split out into its own module file so projects can use
the CTEST_USE_LAUNCHERS functionality independently.
.sp
To use launchers, set CTEST_USE_LAUNCHERS to ON in a ctest \-S
dashboard script, and then also set it in the cache of the configured
project.  Both cmake and ctest need to know the value of it for the
launchers to work properly.  CMake needs to know in order to generate
proper build rules, and ctest, in order to produce the proper error
and warning analysis.
.sp
For convenience, you may set the ENV variable
CTEST_USE_LAUNCHERS_DEFAULT in your ctest \-S script, too.  Then, as
long as your CMakeLists uses include(CTest) or
include(CTestUseLaunchers), it will use the value of the ENV variable
to initialize a CTEST_USE_LAUNCHERS cache variable.  This cache
variable initialization only occurs if CTEST_USE_LAUNCHERS is not
already defined. If CTEST_USE_LAUNCHERS is on in a ctest \-S script
the ctest_configure command will add \-DCTEST_USE_LAUNCHERS:BOOL=TRUE
to the cmake command used to configure the project.

.SS ExternalData
.sp
Manage data files stored outside source tree
.SS Introduction
.sp
Use this module to unambiguously reference data files stored outside
the source tree and fetch them at build time from arbitrary local and
remote content\-addressed locations.  Functions provided by this module
recognize arguments with the syntax \fBDATA{<name>}\fP as references to
external data, replace them with full paths to local copies of those
data, and create build rules to fetch and update the local copies.
.sp
For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
include(ExternalData)
set(ExternalData_URL_TEMPLATES "file:///local/%(algo)/%(hash)"
                               "file:////host/share/%(algo)/%(hash)"
                               "http://data.org/%(algo)/%(hash)")

  NAME MyTest
  COMMAND MyExe DATA{MyInput.png}
  )
ExternalData_Add_Target(MyData)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
When test \fBMyTest\fP runs the \fBDATA{MyInput.png}\fP argument will be
replaced by the full path to a real instance of the data file
\fBMyInput.png\fP on disk.  If the source tree contains a content link
such as \fBMyInput.png.md5\fP then the \fBMyData\fP target creates a real
\fBMyInput.png\fP in the build tree.

.B ExternalData_BINARY_ROOT
The \fBExternalData_BINARY_ROOT\fP variable may be set to the directory to
hold the real data files named by expanded \fBDATA{}\fP references.  The

.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B ExternalData_LINK_CONTENT
The \fBExternalData_LINK_CONTENT\fP variable may be set to the name of a
supported hash algorithm to enable automatic conversion of real data
files referenced by the \fBDATA{}\fP syntax into content links.  For each
such \fB<file>\fP a content link named \fB<file><ext>\fP is created.  The
original file is renamed to the form \fB\&.ExternalData_<algo>_<hash>\fP to
stage it for future transmission to one of the locations in the list
of URL templates (by means outside the scope of this module).  The
data fetch rule created for the content link will use the staged
object if it cannot be found using any URL template.
.UNINDENT

.TP
.B ExternalData_NO_SYMLINKS
The real data files named by expanded \fBDATA{}\fP references may be made

.TP
.B ExternalData_OBJECT_STORES
The \fBExternalData_OBJECT_STORES\fP variable may be set to a list of local
directories that store objects using the layout \fB<dir>/%(algo)/%(hash)\fP\&.
These directories will be searched first for a needed object.  If the
object is not available in any store then it will be fetched remotely

.SS Referencing Files
.SS Referencing Single Files
.sp
The \fBDATA{}\fP syntax is literal and the \fB<name>\fP is a full or relative path
within the source tree.  The source tree must contain either a real
data file at \fB<name>\fP or a "content link" at \fB<name><ext>\fP containing a
hash of the real file using a hash algorithm corresponding to \fB<ext>\fP\&.
For example, the argument \fBDATA{img.png}\fP may be satisfied by either a
real \fBimg.png\fP file in the current source directory or a \fBimg.png.md5\fP
file containing its MD5 sum.
.sp
Multiple content links of the same name with different hash algorithms
are supported (e.g. \fBimg.png.sha256\fP and \fBimg.png.sha1\fP) so long as
they all correspond to the same real file.  This allows objects to be
fetched from sources indexed by different hash algorithms.
.SS Referencing File Series
.sp
The \fBDATA{}\fP syntax can be told to fetch a file series using the form
\fBDATA{<name>,:}\fP, where the \fB:\fP is literal.  If the source tree
contains a group of files or content links named like a series then a
reference to one member adds rules to fetch all of them.  Although all
members of a series are fetched, only the file originally named by the
\fBDATA{}\fP argument is substituted for it.  The default configuration
recognizes file series names ending with \fB#.ext\fP, \fB_#.ext\fP, \fB\&.#.ext\fP,
or \fB\-#.ext\fP where \fB#\fP is a sequence of decimal digits and \fB\&.ext\fP is
any single extension.  Configure it with a regex that parses \fB<number>\fP
and \fB<suffix>\fP parts from the end of \fB<name>\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
ExternalData_SERIES_PARSE = regex of the form (<number>)(<suffix>)$

.SS Referencing Associated Files
.sp
The \fBDATA{}\fP syntax can alternatively match files associated with the
named file and contained in the same directory.  Associated files may
be specified by options using the syntax
\fBDATA{<name>,<opt1>,<opt2>,...}\fP\&.  Each option may specify one file by
name or specify a regular expression to match file names using the
syntax \fBREGEX:<regex>\fP\&.  For example, the arguments:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
DATA{MyData/MyInput.mhd,MyInput.img}                   # File pair
DATA{MyData/MyFrames00.png,REGEX:MyFrames[0\-9]+\e\e.png} # Series

.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
will pass \fBMyInput.mha\fP and \fBMyFrames00.png\fP on the command line but
ensure that the associated files are present next to them.
.SS Referencing Directories
.sp
The \fBDATA{}\fP syntax may reference a directory using a trailing slash and
a list of associated files.  The form \fBDATA{<name>/,<opt1>,<opt2>,...}\fP
adds rules to fetch any files in the directory that match one of the
associated file options.  For example, the argument
\fBDATA{MyDataDir/,REGEX:.*}\fP will pass the full path to a \fBMyDataDir\fP
directory on the command line and ensure that the directory contains
files corresponding to every file or content link in the \fBMyDataDir\fP
source directory.  In order to match associated files in subdirectories,
specify a \fBRECURSE:\fP option, e.g. \fBDATA{MyDataDir/,RECURSE:,REGEX:.*}\fP\&.

.SS Custom Fetch Scripts
.sp
When a data file must be fetched from one of the URL templates
specified in the \fBExternalData_URL_TEMPLATES\fP variable, it is
normally downloaded using the \fBfile(DOWNLOAD)\fP command.
One may specify usage of a custom fetch script by using a URL
template of the form \fBExternalDataCustomScript://<key>/<loc>\fP\&.
The \fB<key>\fP must be a C identifier, and the \fB<loc>\fP must
contain the \fB%(algo)\fP and \fB%(hash)\fP placeholders.
A variable corresponding to the key, \fBExternalData_CUSTOM_SCRIPT_<key>\fP,
must be set to the full path to a \fB\&.cmake\fP script file.  The script
will be included to perform the actual fetch, and provided with
the following variables:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B ExternalData_CUSTOM_LOCATION
When a custom fetch script is loaded, this variable is set to the
location part of the URL, which will contain the substituted hash
algorithm name and content hash value.

interpreted in any way.
.UNINDENT

The custom fetch script is expected to store fetched content in the
file or set a variable:

structure used for the management of the external project can also be
customized. The function supports a large number of options which can be used
to tailor the external project behavior.
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
\fBDirectory Options:\fP
Most of the time, the default directory layout is sufficient. It is largely
an implementation detail that the main project usually doesn\(aqt need to
change. In some circumstances, however, control over the directory layout
can be useful or necessary. The directory options are potentially more
useful from the point of view that the main build can use the
\fI\%ExternalProject_Get_Property()\fP command to retrieve their values,
thereby allowing the main project to refer to build artifacts of the
external project.
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fBPREFIX <dir>\fP
Root directory for the external project. Unless otherwise noted below,
all other directories associated with the external project will be
created under here.
.TP
.B \fBTMP_DIR <dir>\fP
Directory in which to store temporary files.
.TP
.B \fBSTAMP_DIR <dir>\fP
Directory in which to store the timestamps of each step. Log files from
individual steps are also created in here (see \fILogging Options\fP below).
.TP
.B \fBDOWNLOAD_DIR <dir>\fP
Directory in which to store downloaded files before unpacking them. This
directory is only used by the URL download method, all other download
methods use \fBSOURCE_DIR\fP directly instead.
.TP
.B \fBSOURCE_DIR <dir>\fP
Source directory into which downloaded contents will be unpacked, or for
non\-URL download methods, the directory in which the repository should be
checked out, cloned, etc. If no download method is specified, this must
point to an existing directory where the external project has already
been unpacked or cloned/checked out.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
If a download method is specified, any existing contents of the source
directory may be deleted. Only the URL download method checks whether
this directory is either missing or empty before initiating the
download, stopping with an error if it is not empty. All other
download methods silently discard any previous contents of the source
directory.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \fBBINARY_DIR <dir>\fP
Specify the build directory location. This option is ignored if
\fBBUILD_IN_SOURCE\fP is enabled.
.TP
.B \fBINSTALL_DIR <dir>\fP
Installation prefix to be placed in the \fB<INSTALL_DIR>\fP placeholder.
This does not actually configure the external project to install to
the given prefix. That must be done by passing appropriate arguments
to the external project configuration step, e.g. using \fB<INSTALL_DIR>\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.sp
If any of the above \fB\&..._DIR\fP options are not specified, their defaults
are computed as follows. If the \fBPREFIX\fP option is given or the
\fBEP_PREFIX\fP directory property is set, then an external project is built
and installed under the specified prefix:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
TMP_DIR      = <prefix>/tmp
STAMP_DIR    = <prefix>/src/<name>\-stamp

BINARY_DIR   = <prefix>/src/<name>\-build
INSTALL_DIR  = <prefix>
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Otherwise, if the \fBEP_BASE\fP directory property is set then components
of an external project are stored under the specified base:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
TMP_DIR      = <base>/tmp/<name>
STAMP_DIR    = <base>/Stamp/<name>

BINARY_DIR   = <base>/Build/<name>
INSTALL_DIR  = <base>/Install/<name>
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If no \fBPREFIX\fP, \fBEP_PREFIX\fP, or \fBEP_BASE\fP is specified, then the
default is to set \fBPREFIX\fP to \fB<name>\-prefix\fP\&. Relative paths are
interpreted with respect to \fBCMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR\fP at the
point where \fBExternalProject_Add()\fP is called.
.TP
\fBDownload Step Options:\fP
A download method can be omitted if the \fBSOURCE_DIR\fP option is used to
point to an existing non\-empty directory. Otherwise, one of the download
methods below must be specified (multiple download methods should not be
given) or a custom \fBDOWNLOAD_COMMAND\fP provided.
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fBDOWNLOAD_COMMAND <cmd>...\fP
Overrides the command used for the download step
(\fBgenerator expressions\fP are
supported). If this option is specified, all other download options will
be ignored. Providing an empty string for \fB<cmd>\fP effectively disables
the download step.
.TP
.B \fIURL Download\fP
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fBURL <url1> [<url2>...]\fP
List of paths and/or URL(s) of the external project\(aqs source. When more
than one URL is given, they are tried in turn until one succeeds. A URL
may be an ordinary path in the local file system (in which case it
must be the only URL provided) or any downloadable URL supported by the
\fBfile(DOWNLOAD)\fP command. A local filesystem path may refer to
either an existing directory or to an archive file, whereas a URL is
expected to point to a file which can be treated as an archive. When an
archive is used, it will be unpacked automatically unless the
\fBDOWNLOAD_NO_EXTRACT\fP option is set to prevent it. The archive type
is determined by inspecting the actual content rather than using logic
based on the file extension.
.TP
.B \fBURL_HASH ALGO=<value>\fP
Hash of the archive file to be downloaded. The \fB<value>\fP should be of
the form \fBalgo=hashValue\fP where \fBalgo\fP can be any of the hashing
algorithms supported by the \fBfile()\fP command. Specifying this
option is strongly recommended for URL downloads, as it ensures the
integrity of the downloaded content. It is also used as a check for a
previously downloaded file, allowing connection to the remote location
to be avoided altogether if the local directory already has a file from
an earlier download that matches the specified hash.
.TP
.B \fBURL_MD5 <md5>\fP
Equivalent to \fBURL_HASH MD5=<md5>\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBDOWNLOAD_NAME <fname>\fP
File name to use for the downloaded file. If not given, the end of the
URL is used to determine the file name. This option is rarely needed,
the default name is generally suitable and is not normally used outside
of code internal to the \fBExternalProject\fP module.
.TP
.B \fBDOWNLOAD_NO_EXTRACT <bool>\fP
Allows the extraction part of the download step to be disabled by
passing a boolean true value for this option. If this option is not
given, the downloaded contents will be unpacked automatically if
required. If extraction has been disabled, the full path to the
downloaded file is available as \fB<DOWNLOADED_FILE>\fP in subsequent
steps or as the property \fBDOWNLOADED_FILE\fP with the
\fI\%ExternalProject_Get_Property()\fP command.
.TP
.B \fBDOWNLOAD_NO_PROGRESS <bool>\fP
Can be used to disable logging the download progress. If this option is
not given, download progress messages will be logged.
.TP
.B \fBTIMEOUT <seconds>\fP
Maximum time allowed for file download operations.
.TP
.B \fBHTTP_USERNAME <username>\fP
Username for the download operation if authentication is required.
.TP
.B \fBHTTP_PASSWORD <password>\fP
Password for the download operation if authentication is required.
.TP
.B \fBHTTP_HEADER <header1> [<header2>...]\fP
Provides an arbitrary list of HTTP headers for the download operation.
This can be useful for accessing content in systems like AWS, etc.
.TP
.B \fBTLS_VERIFY <bool>\fP
Specifies whether certificate verification should be performed for
https URLs. If this option is not provided, the default behavior is
determined by the \fBCMAKE_TLS_VERIFY\fP variable (see
\fBfile(DOWNLOAD)\fP). If that is also not set, certificate
verification will not be performed. In situations where \fBURL_HASH\fP
cannot be provided, this option can be an alternative verification
measure.
.TP
.B \fBTLS_CAINFO <file>\fP
Specify a custom certificate authority file to use if \fBTLS_VERIFY\fP
is enabled. If this option is not specified, the value of the
\fBCMAKE_TLS_CAINFO\fP variable will be used instead (see
\fBfile(DOWNLOAD)\fP)
.UNINDENT

.B \fIGit\fP
NOTE: A git version of 1.6.5 or later is required if this download method
is used.
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fBGIT_REPOSITORY <url>\fP
URL of the git repository. Any URL understood by the \fBgit\fP command
may be used.
.TP
.B \fBGIT_TAG <tag>\fP
Git branch name, tag or commit hash. Note that branch names and tags
should generally be specified as remote names (i.e. \fBorigin/myBranch\fP
rather than simply \fBmyBranch\fP). This ensures that if the remote end
has its tag moved or branch rebased or history rewritten, the local
clone will still be updated correctly. In general, however, specifying
a commit hash should be preferred for a number of reasons:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
If the local clone already has the commit corresponding to the hash,
no \fBgit fetch\fP needs to be performed to check for changes each time
CMake is re\-run. This can result in a significant speed up if many
external projects are being used.
.IP \(bu 2
Using a specific git hash ensures that the main project\(aqs own history
is fully traceable to a specific point in the external project\(aqs
evolution. If a branch or tag name is used instead, then checking out
a specific commit of the main project doesn\(aqt necessarily pin the
whole build to a specific point in the life of the external project.
The lack of such deterministic behavior makes the main project lose
traceability and repeatability.
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \fBGIT_REMOTE_NAME <name>\fP
The optional name of the remote. If this option is not specified, it
defaults to \fBorigin\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBGIT_SUBMODULES <module>...\fP
Specific git submodules that should also be updated. If this option is
not provided, all git submodules will be updated.
.TP
.B \fBGIT_SHALLOW <bool>\fP
When this option is enabled, the \fBgit clone\fP operation will be given
the \fB\-\-depth 1\fP option. This performs a shallow clone, which avoids
downloading the whole history and instead retrieves just the commit
denoted by the \fBGIT_TAG\fP option.
.TP
.B \fBGIT_PROGRESS <bool>\fP
When enabled, this option instructs the \fBgit clone\fP operation to
report its progress by passing it the \fB\-\-progress\fP option. Without
this option, the clone step for large projects may appear to make the
build stall, since nothing will be logged until the clone operation
finishes. While this option can be used to provide progress to prevent
the appearance of the build having stalled, it may also make the build
overly noisy if lots of external projects are used.
.TP
.B \fBGIT_CONFIG <option1> [<option2>...]\fP
Specify a list of config options to pass to \fBgit clone\fP\&. Each option
listed will be transformed into its own \fB\-\-config <option>\fP on the
\fBgit clone\fP command line, with each option required to be in the
form \fBkey=value\fP\&.

\fBUpdate/Patch Step Options:\fP
Whenever CMake is re\-run, by default the external project\(aqs sources will be

would be checked if the \fBGIT_TAG\fP does not refer to a specific commit).
.INDENT 7.0

Overrides the download method\(aqs update step with a custom command.
The command may use
\fBgenerator expressions\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBUPDATE_DISCONNECTED <bool>\fP
When enabled, this option causes the update step to be skipped. It does
not, however, prevent the download step. The update step can still be
added as a step target (see \fI\%ExternalProject_Add_StepTargets()\fP)
and called manually. This is useful if you want to allow developers to
build the project when disconnected from the network (the network may
still be needed for the download step though).
.sp
When this option is present, it is generally advisable to make the value
a cache variable under the developer\(aqs control rather than hard\-coding
it. If this option is not present, the default value is taken from the
\fBEP_UPDATE_DISCONNECTED\fP directory property. If that is also not
defined, updates are performed as normal. The \fBEP_UPDATE_DISCONNECTED\fP
directory property is intended as a convenience for controlling the
\fBUPDATE_DISCONNECTED\fP behavior for an entire section of a project\(aqs
directory hierarchy and may be a more convenient method of giving
developers control over whether or not to perform updates (assuming the
project also provides a cache variable or some other convenient method
for setting the directory property).
.TP
.B \fBPATCH_COMMAND <cmd>...\fP
Specifies a custom command to patch the sources after an update. By
default, no patch command is defined. Note that it can be quite difficult
to define an appropriate patch command that performs robustly, especially
for download methods such as git where changing the \fBGIT_TAG\fP will not
discard changes from a previous patch, but the patch command will be
called again after updating to the new tag.
.UNINDENT
.TP
\fBConfigure Step Options:\fP
The configure step is run after the download and update steps. By default,
the external project is assumed to be a CMake project, but this can be
overridden if required.
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fBCONFIGURE_COMMAND <cmd>...\fP
The default configure command runs CMake with options based on the main
project. For non\-CMake external projects, the \fBCONFIGURE_COMMAND\fP
option must be used to override this behavior
(\fBgenerator expressions\fP are
supported). For projects that require no configure step, specify this
option with an empty string as the command to execute.
.TP
.B \fBCMAKE_COMMAND /.../cmake\fP
Specify an alternative cmake executable for the configure step (use an
absolute path). This is generally not recommended, since it is
usually desirable to use the same CMake version throughout the whole
build. This option is ignored if a custom configure command has been
specified with \fBCONFIGURE_COMMAND\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBCMAKE_GENERATOR <gen>\fP
Override the CMake generator used for the configure step. Without this
option, the same generator as the main build will be used. This option is
ignored if a custom configure command has been specified with the
\fBCONFIGURE_COMMAND\fP option.
.TP
.B \fBCMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM <platform>\fP
Pass a generator\-specific platform name to the CMake command (see
\fBCMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM\fP). It is an error to provide this
option without the \fBCMAKE_GENERATOR\fP option.
.TP
.B \fBCMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET <toolset>\fP
Pass a generator\-specific toolset name to the CMake command (see
\fBCMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET\fP). It is an error to provide this
option without the \fBCMAKE_GENERATOR\fP option.
.TP
.B \fBCMAKE_ARGS <arg>...\fP
The specified arguments are passed to the \fBcmake\fP command line. They
can be any argument the \fBcmake\fP command understands, not just cache
values defined by \fB\-D...\fP arguments (see also
\fBCMake Options\fP). In addition, arguments may use
\fBgenerator expressions\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBCMAKE_CACHE_ARGS <arg>...\fP
This is an alternate way of specifying cache variables where command line
length issues may become a problem. The arguments are expected to be in
the form \fB\-Dvar:STRING=value\fP, which are then transformed into
CMake \fBset()\fP commands with the \fBFORCE\fP option used. These
\fBset()\fP commands are written to a pre\-load script which is then applied
using the \fBcmake \-C\fP command line option. Arguments
may use \fBgenerator expressions\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBCMAKE_CACHE_DEFAULT_ARGS <arg>...\fP
This is the same as the \fBCMAKE_CACHE_ARGS\fP option except the \fBset()\fP
commands do not include the \fBFORCE\fP keyword. This means the values act
as initial defaults only and will not override any variables already set
from a previous run. Use this option with care, as it can lead to
different behavior depending on whether the build starts from a fresh
build directory or re\-uses previous build contents.
.TP
.B \fBSOURCE_SUBDIR <dir>\fP
When no \fBCONFIGURE_COMMAND\fP option is specified, the configure step
assumes the external project has a \fBCMakeLists.txt\fP file at the top of
its source tree (i.e. in \fBSOURCE_DIR\fP). The \fBSOURCE_SUBDIR\fP option
can be used to point to an alternative directory within the source tree

\fBBuild Step Options:\fP
If the configure step assumed the external project uses CMake as its build
system, the build step will also. Otherwise, the build step will assume a
Makefile\-based build and simply run \fBmake\fP with no arguments as the
default build step. This can be overridden with custom build commands if
required.
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fBBUILD_COMMAND <cmd>...\fP
Overrides the default build command
(\fBgenerator expressions\fP are
supported). If this option is not given, the default build command will
be chosen to integrate with the main build in the most appropriate way
(e.g. using recursive \fBmake\fP for Makefile generators or
\fBcmake \-\-build\fP if the project uses a CMake build). This option can be
specified with an empty string as the command to make the build step do
nothing.
.TP
.B \fBBUILD_IN_SOURCE <bool>\fP
When this option is enabled, the build will be done directly within the
external project\(aqs source tree. This should generally be avoided, the use
of a separate build directory is usually preferred, but it can be useful
when the external project assumes an in\-source build. The \fBBINARY_DIR\fP
option should not be specified if building in\-source.
.TP
.B \fBBUILD_ALWAYS <bool>\fP
Enabling this option forces the build step to always be run. This can be
the easiest way to robustly ensure that the external project\(aqs own build
dependencies are evaluated rather than relying on the default
success timestamp\-based method. This option is not normally needed unless
developers are expected to modify something the external project\(aqs build
depends on in a way that is not detectable via the step target
dependencies (e.g. \fBSOURCE_DIR\fP is used without a download method and
developers might modify the sources in \fBSOURCE_DIR\fP).
.TP
.B \fBBUILD_BYPRODUCTS <file>...\fP
Specifies files that will be generated by the build command but which
might or might not have their modification time updated by subsequent
builds. These ultimately get passed through as \fBBYPRODUCTS\fP to the
build step\(aqs own underlying call to \fBadd_custom_command()\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.TP
\fBInstall Step Options:\fP
If the configure step assumed the external project uses CMake as its build
system, the install step will also. Otherwise, the install step will assume
a Makefile\-based build and simply run \fBmake install\fP as the default build
step. This can be overridden with custom install commands if required.
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fBINSTALL_COMMAND <cmd>...\fP
The external project\(aqs own install step is invoked as part of the main
project\(aqs \fIbuild\fP\&. It is done after the external project\(aqs build step
and may be before or after the external project\(aqs test step (see the
\fBTEST_BEFORE_INSTALL\fP option below). The external project\(aqs install
rules are not part of the main project\(aqs install rules, so if anything
from the external project should be installed as part of the main build,
these need to be specified in the main build as additional
\fBinstall()\fP commands. The default install step builds the
\fBinstall\fP target of the external project, but this can be overridden
with a custom command using this option
(\fBgenerator expressions\fP are
supported). Passing an empty string as the \fB<cmd>\fP makes the install
step do nothing.
.UNINDENT

\fBTest Step Options:\fP
The test step is only defined if at least one of the following \fBTEST_...\fP
options are provided.
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fBTEST_COMMAND <cmd>...\fP
Overrides the default test command
(\fBgenerator expressions\fP are
supported). If this option is not given, the default behavior of the test
step is to build the external project\(aqs own \fBtest\fP target. This option
can be specified with \fB<cmd>\fP as an empty string, which allows the test
step to still be defined, but it will do nothing. Do not specify any of
the other \fBTEST_...\fP options if providing an empty string as the test
command, but prefer to omit all \fBTEST_...\fP options altogether if the
test step target is not needed.
.TP
.B \fBTEST_BEFORE_INSTALL <bool>\fP
When this option is enabled, the test step will be executed before the
install step. The default behavior is for the test step to run after the
install step.
.TP
.B \fBTEST_AFTER_INSTALL <bool>\fP
This option is mainly useful as a way to indicate that the test step is
desired but all default behavior is sufficient. Specifying this option
with a boolean true value ensures the test step is defined and that it
comes after the install step. If both \fBTEST_BEFORE_INSTALL\fP and
\fBTEST_AFTER_INSTALL\fP are enabled, the latter is silently ignored.
.TP
.B \fBTEST_EXCLUDE_FROM_MAIN <bool>\fP
If enabled, the main build\(aqs default ALL target will not depend on the
test step. This can be a useful way of ensuring the test step is defined
but only gets invoked when manually requested.

\fBOutput Logging Options:\fP
Each of the following \fBLOG_...\fP options can be used to wrap the relevant

\fBTerminal Access Options:\fP
Steps can be given direct access to the terminal in some cases. Giving a
step access to the terminal may allow it to receive terminal input if
required, such as for authentication details not provided by other options.
With the \fBNinja\fP generator, these options place the steps in the
\fBconsole\fP \fBjob pool\fP\&. Each step can be given access
to the terminal individually via the following options:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fBUSES_TERMINAL_DOWNLOAD <bool>\fP
Give the download step access to the terminal.
.TP
.B \fBUSES_TERMINAL_UPDATE <bool>\fP

\fBTarget Options:\fP
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fBDEPENDS <targets>...\fP
Specify other targets on which the external project depends. The other
targets will be brought up to date before any of the external project\(aqs
steps are executed. Because the external project uses additional custom
targets internally for each step, the \fBDEPENDS\fP option is the most
convenient way to ensure all of those steps depend on the other targets.
Simply doing
\fBadd_dependencies(<name> <targets>)\fP will
not make any of the steps dependent on \fB<targets>\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBEXCLUDE_FROM_ALL <bool>\fP
When enabled, this option excludes the external project from the default
ALL target of the main build.
.TP
.B \fBSTEP_TARGETS <step\-target>...\fP
Generate custom targets for the specified steps. This is required if the
steps need to be triggered manually or if they need to be used as
dependencies of other targets. If this option is not specified, the
default value is taken from the \fBEP_STEP_TARGETS\fP directory property.
See \fI\%ExternalProject_Add_Step()\fP below for further discussion of
the effects of this option.
.TP
.B \fBINDEPENDENT_STEP_TARGETS <step\-target>...\fP
Generate custom targets for the specified steps and prevent these targets
from having the usual dependencies applied to them. If this option is not
specified, the default value is taken from the
\fBEP_INDEPENDENT_STEP_TARGETS\fP directory property. This option is mostly
useful for allowing individual steps to be driven independently, such as
for a CDash setup where each step should be initiated and reported
individually rather than as one whole build. See
\fI\%ExternalProject_Add_Step()\fP below for further discussion of the
effects of this option.

The \fBExternalProject_Add()\fP function on its own is often sufficient for

require additional work to implement desired behavior, such as adding in a
custom step or making steps available as manually triggerable targets. The

files will ultimately be passed through as the \fBBYPRODUCTS\fP option to the
\fBadd_custom_command()\fP used to implement the custom step internally.

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Creating a target for a step allows it to be used as a dependency of another
target or to be triggered manually. Having targets for specific steps also
allows them to be driven independently of each other by specifying targets on
build command lines. For example, you may be submitting to a sub\-project
based dashboard where you want to drive the configure portion of the build,
then submit to the dashboard, followed by the build portion, followed
by tests. If you invoke a custom target that depends on a step halfway
through the step dependency chain, then all the previous steps will also run
to ensure everything is up to date.
.sp
If the \fBNO_DEPENDS\fP option is specified, the step target will not depend on
the dependencies of the external project (i.e. on any dependencies of the
\fB<name>\fP custom target created by \fI\%ExternalProject_Add()\fP). This is
usually safe for the \fBdownload\fP, \fBupdate\fP and \fBpatch\fP steps, since they
do not typically require that the dependencies are updated and built. Using
\fBNO_DEPENDS\fP for any of the other pre\-defined steps, however, may break
parallel builds. Only use \fBNO_DEPENDS\fP where it is certain that the named
steps genuinely do not have dependencies. For custom steps, consider whether
or not the custom commands require the dependencies to be configured, built
and installed.
.sp
Internally, \fI\%ExternalProject_Add()\fP calls
\fI\%ExternalProject_Add_Step()\fP to create each step. If any
\fBSTEP_TARGETS\fP or \fBINDEPENDENT_STEP_TARGETS\fP were specified, then
\fBExternalProject_Add_StepTargets()\fP will also be called after
\fI\%ExternalProject_Add_Step()\fP\&. \fBINDEPENDENT_STEP_TARGETS\fP have the
\fBNO_DEPENDS\fP option set, whereas \fBSTEP_TARGETS\fP do not. Other than that,
the two options result in \fBExternalProject_Add_StepTargets()\fP being called
in the same way. Even if a step is not mentioned in either of those two
options, \fBExternalProject_Add_StepTargets()\fP can still be called later to
manually define a target for the step.
.sp
The \fBSTEP_TARGETS\fP and \fBINDEPENDENT_STEP_TARGETS\fP options for
\fI\%ExternalProject_Add()\fP are generally the easiest way to ensure
targets are created for specific steps of interest. For custom steps,
\fBExternalProject_Add_StepTargets()\fP must be called explicitly if a target
should also be created for that custom step. An alternative to these two
options is to populate the \fBEP_STEP_TARGETS\fP and
\fBEP_INDEPENDENT_STEP_TARGETS\fP directory properties. These act as defaults
for the step target options and can save having to repeatedly specify the
same set of step targets when multiple external projects are being defined.

.B ExternalProject_Add_StepDependencies
The \fBExternalProject_Add_StepDependencies()\fP function can be used to add

The \fBfeature_summary()\fP macro can be used to print information about
enabled or disabled packages or features of a project.  By default,
only the names of the features/packages will be printed and their
required version when one was specified.  Use \fBset_package_properties()\fP
to add more useful information, like e.g.  a download URL for the
respective package or their purpose in the project.
.sp
The \fBWHAT\fP option is the only mandatory option.  Here you specify what
information will be printed:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fBALL\fP
print everything
.TP
.B \fBENABLED_FEATURES\fP
the list of all features which are enabled
.TP
.B \fBDISABLED_FEATURES\fP
the list of all features which are disabled
.TP
.B \fBPACKAGES_FOUND\fP
the list of all packages which have been found
.TP
.B \fBPACKAGES_NOT_FOUND\fP
the list of all packages which have not been found
.UNINDENT
.sp
For each package type \fB<TYPE>\fP defined by the
\fI\%FeatureSummary_PKG_TYPES\fP global property, the following
information can also be used:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fB<TYPE>_PACKAGES_FOUND\fP
only those packages which have been found which have the type <TYPE>
.TP
.B \fB<TYPE>_PACKAGES_NOT_FOUND\fP
only those packages which have not been found which have the type <TYPE>
.UNINDENT
.sp
With the exception of the \fBALL\fP value, these values can be combined
in order to customize the output. For example:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp

feature_summary(WHAT ENABLED_FEATURES DISABLED_FEATURES)

If a \fBFILENAME\fP is given, the information is printed into this file.  If
\fBAPPEND\fP is used, it is appended to this file, otherwise the file is
overwritten if it already existed.  If the VAR option is used, the
information is "printed" into the specified variable.  If \fBFILENAME\fP is
not used, the information is printed to the terminal.  Using the
\fBDESCRIPTION\fP option a description or headline can be set which will be
printed above the actual content.  If only one type of
package was requested, no title is printed, unless it is explicitly set using
either \fBDESCRIPTION\fP to use a custom string, or \fBDEFAULT_DESCRIPTION\fP to
use a default title for the requested type.
If \fBINCLUDE_QUIET_PACKAGES\fP is given, packages which have been searched with
\fBfind_package(... QUIET)\fP will also be listed. By default they are skipped.
If \fBFATAL_ON_MISSING_REQUIRED_PACKAGES\fP is given, CMake will abort if a
package which is marked as one of the package types listed in the
\fI\%FeatureSummary_REQUIRED_PKG_TYPES\fP global property has not been
found.
The default value for the \fI\%FeatureSummary_REQUIRED_PKG_TYPES\fP global
property is \fBREQUIRED\fP\&.
.sp
The \fI\%FeatureSummary_DEFAULT_PKG_TYPE\fP global property can be
modified to change the default package type assigned when not explicitly
assigned by the user.
.sp
If the \fBQUIET_ON_EMPTY\fP option is used, if only one type of package was
requested, and no packages belonging to that category were found, then no
output (including the \fBDESCRIPTION\fP) is printed or added to the \fBVAR\fP
variable.
.sp

Use this macro to set up information about the named package, which
can then be displayed via FEATURE_SUMMARY().  This can be done either
directly in the Find\-module or in the project which uses the module
after the find_package() call.  The features for which information can
be set are added automatically by the find_package() command.
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fBURL <url>\fP
This should be the homepage of the package, or something similar.
Ideally this is set already directly in the Find\-module.
.TP
.B \fBDESCRIPTION <description>\fP
A short description what that package is, at most one sentence.
Ideally this is set already directly in the Find\-module.
.TP
.B \fBTYPE <type>\fP
What type of dependency has the using project on that package.
Default is \fBOPTIONAL\fP\&.  In this case it is a package which can be used
by the project when available at buildtime, but it also work without.
\fBRECOMMENDED\fP is similar to \fBOPTIONAL\fP, i.e.  the project will build if
the package is not present, but the functionality of the resulting
binaries will be severly limited.  If a \fBREQUIRED\fP package is not
available at buildtime, the project may not even build.  This can be
combined with the \fBFATAL_ON_MISSING_REQUIRED_PACKAGES\fP argument for
\fBfeature_summary()\fP\&.  Last, a \fBRUNTIME\fP package is a package which is
actually not used at all during the build, but which is required for
actually running the resulting binaries.  So if such a package is
missing, the project can still be built, but it may not work later on.
If \fBset_package_properties()\fP is called multiple times for the same
package with different TYPEs, the \fBTYPE\fP is only changed to higher
TYPEs (\fBRUNTIME < OPTIONAL < RECOMMENDED < REQUIRED\fP), lower TYPEs are
ignored.  The \fBTYPE\fP property is project\-specific, so it cannot be set
by the Find\-module, but must be set in the project.
Type accepted can be changed by setting the
\fI\%FeatureSummary_PKG_TYPES\fP global property.
.TP
.B \fBPURPOSE <purpose>\fP
This describes which features this package enables in the
project, i.e.  it tells the user what functionality he gets in the
resulting binaries.  If set_package_properties() is called multiple
times for a package, all PURPOSE properties are appended to a list of
purposes of the package in the project.  As the TYPE property, also
the PURPOSE property is project\-specific, so it cannot be set by the
Find\-module, but must be set in the project.

Implicit dependencies such as Boost::filesystem requiring
Boost::system will be automatically detected and satisfied, even
if system is not specified when using find_package and if
Boost::system is not added to target_link_libraries.  If using
Boost::thread, then Threads::Threads will also be added automatically.
.sp
It is important to note that the imported targets behave differently
than variables created by this module: multiple calls to
find_package(Boost) in the same directory or sub\-directories with
different options (e.g. static or shared) will not override the
values of the targets created by the first call.
.sp
Users may set these hints or results as cache entries.  Projects
should not read these entries directly but instead use the above
result variables.  Note that some hint names start in upper\-case
"BOOST".  One may specify these as environment variables if they are
not specified as CMake variables or cache entries.
.sp
This module first searches for the Boost header files using the above
hint variables (excluding BOOST_LIBRARYDIR) and saves the result in
Boost_INCLUDE_DIR.  Then it searches for requested component libraries
using the above hints (excluding BOOST_INCLUDEDIR and
Boost_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS), "lib" directories near Boost_INCLUDE_DIR,
and the library name configuration settings below.  It saves the
library directories in Boost_LIBRARY_DIR_DEBUG and
Boost_LIBRARY_DIR_RELEASE and individual library
locations in Boost_<C>_LIBRARY_DEBUG and Boost_<C>_LIBRARY_RELEASE.
When one changes settings used by previous searches in the same build
tree (excluding environment variables) this module discards previous
search results affected by the changes and searches again.

                           (\(aqn\(aq tag).  Default is OFF.
Boost_COMPILER           \- Set to the compiler\-specific library suffix
                           (e.g. "\-gcc43").  Default is auto\-computed
                           for the C++ compiler in use.  A list may be
                           used if multiple compatible suffixes should
                           be tested for, in decreasing order of
                           preference.
Boost_THREADAPI          \- Suffix for "thread" component library name,

                           and without this suffix will both be tried.
Boost_NAMESPACE          \- Alternate namespace used to build boost with
                           e.g. if set to "myboost", will search for

Tools for building CUDA C files: libraries and build dependencies.
.sp
This script locates the NVIDIA CUDA C tools.  It should work on linux,
windows, and mac and should be reasonably up to date with CUDA C
releases.
.sp
This script makes use of the standard find_package arguments of
<VERSION>, REQUIRED and QUIET.  CUDA_FOUND will report if an
acceptable version of CUDA was found.
.sp
The script will prompt the user to specify CUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR if
the prefix cannot be determined by the location of nvcc in the system
path and REQUIRED is specified to find_package().  To use a different
installed version of the toolkit set the environment variable
CUDA_BIN_PATH before running cmake (e.g.
CUDA_BIN_PATH=/usr/local/cuda1.0 instead of the default
/usr/local/cuda) or set CUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR after configuring.  If
you change the value of CUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR, various components that
depend on the path will be relocated.
.sp
It might be necessary to set CUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR manually on certain
platforms, or to use a cuda runtime not installed in the default
location.  In newer versions of the toolkit the cuda library is
included with the graphics driver\- be sure that the driver version
matches what is needed by the cuda runtime version.
.sp
The following variables affect the behavior of the macros in the
script (in alphebetical order).  Note that any of these flags can be
changed multiple times in the same directory before calling
CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE, CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY, CUDA_COMPILE, CUDA_COMPILE_PTX,
CUDA_COMPILE_FATBIN, CUDA_COMPILE_CUBIN or CUDA_WRAP_SRCS:

CUDA_64_BIT_DEVICE_CODE (Default matches host bit size)
\-\- Set to ON to compile for 64 bit device code, OFF for 32 bit device code.
   Note that making this different from the host code when generating object
   or C files from CUDA code just won\(aqt work, because size_t gets defined by
   nvcc in the generated source.  If you compile to PTX and then load the
   file yourself, you can mix bit sizes between device and host.

CUDA_ATTACH_VS_BUILD_RULE_TO_CUDA_FILE (Default ON)
\-\- Set to ON if you want the custom build rule to be attached to the source
   file in Visual Studio.  Turn OFF if you add the same cuda file to multiple
   targets.

   This allows the user to build the target from the CUDA file; however, bad
   things can happen if the CUDA source file is added to multiple targets.
   When performing parallel builds it is possible for the custom build
   command to be run more than once and in parallel causing cryptic build
   errors.  VS runs the rules for every source file in the target, and a
   source can have only one rule no matter how many projects it is added to.
   When the rule is run from multiple targets race conditions can occur on
   the generated file.  Eventually everything will get built, but if the user
   is unaware of this behavior, there may be confusion.  It would be nice if
   this script could detect the reuse of source files across multiple targets
   and turn the option off for the user, but no good solution could be found.

CUDA_BUILD_CUBIN (Default OFF)
\-\- Set to ON to enable and extra compilation pass with the \-cubin option in
   Device mode. The output is parsed and register, shared memory usage is
   printed during build.

CUDA_BUILD_EMULATION (Default OFF for device mode)
\-\- Set to ON for Emulation mode. \-D_DEVICEEMU is defined for CUDA C files
   when CUDA_BUILD_EMULATION is TRUE.

CUDA_LINK_LIBRARIES_KEYWORD (Default "")
 \-\- The <PRIVATE|PUBLIC|INTERFACE> keyword to use for internal
    target_link_libraries calls. The default is to use no keyword which
    uses the old "plain" form of target_link_libraries. Note that is matters
    because whatever is used inside the FindCUDA module must also be used
    outside \- the two forms of target_link_libraries cannot be mixed.

CUDA_GENERATED_OUTPUT_DIR (Default CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR)
\-\- Set to the path you wish to have the generated files placed.  If it is
   blank output files will be placed in CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR.
   Intermediate files will always be placed in
   CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR/CMakeFiles.

CUDA_HOST_COMPILATION_CPP (Default ON)
\-\- Set to OFF for C compilation of host code.

CUDA_HOST_COMPILER (Default CMAKE_C_COMPILER, $(VCInstallDir)/bin for VS)
\-\- Set the host compiler to be used by nvcc.  Ignored if \-ccbin or
   \-\-compiler\-bindir is already present in the CUDA_NVCC_FLAGS or
   CUDA_NVCC_FLAGS_<CONFIG> variables.  For Visual Studio targets
   $(VCInstallDir)/bin is a special value that expands out to the path when
   the command is run from within VS.

CUDA_NVCC_FLAGS
CUDA_NVCC_FLAGS_<CONFIG>
\-\- Additional NVCC command line arguments.  NOTE: multiple arguments must be
   semi\-colon delimited (e.g. \-\-compiler\-options;\-Wall)

CUDA_PROPAGATE_HOST_FLAGS (Default ON)
\-\- Set to ON to propagate CMAKE_{C,CXX}_FLAGS and their configuration
   dependent counterparts (e.g. CMAKE_C_FLAGS_DEBUG) automatically to the
   host compiler through nvcc\(aqs \-Xcompiler flag.  This helps make the
   generated host code match the rest of the system better.  Sometimes
   certain flags give nvcc problems, and this will help you turn the flag
   propagation off.  This does not affect the flags supplied directly to nvcc
   via CUDA_NVCC_FLAGS or through the OPTION flags specified through
   CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY, CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE, or CUDA_WRAP_SRCS.  Flags used for
   shared library compilation are not affected by this flag.

CUDA_SEPARABLE_COMPILATION (Default OFF)
\-\- If set this will enable separable compilation for all CUDA runtime object
   files.  If used outside of CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE and CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY
   (e.g. calling CUDA_WRAP_SRCS directly),
   CUDA_COMPUTE_SEPARABLE_COMPILATION_OBJECT_FILE_NAME and
   CUDA_LINK_SEPARABLE_COMPILATION_OBJECTS should be called.

CUDA_SOURCE_PROPERTY_FORMAT
\-\- If this source file property is set, it can override the format specified
   to CUDA_WRAP_SRCS (OBJ, PTX, CUBIN, or FATBIN).  If an input source file
   is not a .cu file, setting this file will cause it to be treated as a .cu
   file. See documentation for set_source_files_properties on how to set
   this property.

CUDA_USE_STATIC_CUDA_RUNTIME (Default ON)
\-\- When enabled the static version of the CUDA runtime library will be used
   in CUDA_LIBRARIES.  If the version of CUDA configured doesn\(aqt support
   this option, then it will be silently disabled.

CUDA_VERBOSE_BUILD (Default OFF)
\-\- Set to ON to see all the commands used when building the CUDA file.  When
   using a Makefile generator the value defaults to VERBOSE (run make
   VERBOSE=1 to see output), although setting CUDA_VERBOSE_BUILD to ON will
   always print the output.

CUDA_ADD_CUFFT_TO_TARGET( cuda_target )
\-\- Adds the cufft library to the target (can be any target).  Handles whether
   you are in emulation mode or not.

CUDA_ADD_CUBLAS_TO_TARGET( cuda_target )
\-\- Adds the cublas library to the target (can be any target).  Handles
   whether you are in emulation mode or not.

CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE( cuda_target file0 file1 ...
                     [WIN32] [MACOSX_BUNDLE] [EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL] [OPTIONS ...] )
\-\- Creates an executable "cuda_target" which is made up of the files
   specified.  All of the non CUDA C files are compiled using the standard
   build rules specified by CMAKE and the cuda files are compiled to object
   files using nvcc and the host compiler.  In addition CUDA_INCLUDE_DIRS is
   added automatically to include_directories().  Some standard CMake target
   calls can be used on the target after calling this macro
   (e.g. set_target_properties and target_link_libraries), but setting
   properties that adjust compilation flags will not affect code compiled by
   nvcc.  Such flags should be modified before calling CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE,
   CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY or CUDA_WRAP_SRCS.

CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY( cuda_target file0 file1 ...
                  [STATIC | SHARED | MODULE] [EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL] [OPTIONS ...] )
\-\- Same as CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE except that a library is created.

CUDA_BUILD_CLEAN_TARGET()
\-\- Creates a convience target that deletes all the dependency files
   generated.  You should make clean after running this target to ensure the
   dependency files get regenerated.

CUDA_COMPILE( generated_files file0 file1 ... [STATIC | SHARED | MODULE]
              [OPTIONS ...] )

                                                     object_files )
\-\- Compute the name of the intermediate link file used for separable
   compilation.  This file name is typically passed into
   CUDA_LINK_SEPARABLE_COMPILATION_OBJECTS.  output_file_var is produced
   based on cuda_target the list of objects files that need separable
   compilation as specified by object_files.  If the object_files list is
   empty, then output_file_var will be empty.  This function is called
   automatically for CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY and CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE.  Note that
   this is a function and not a macro.

CUDA_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES( path0 path1 ... )
\-\- Sets the directories that should be passed to nvcc
   (e.g. nvcc \-Ipath0 \-Ipath1 ... ). These paths usually contain other .cu
   files.


CUDA_LINK_SEPARABLE_COMPILATION_OBJECTS( output_file_var cuda_target
                                         nvcc_flags object_files)
\-\- Generates the link object required by separable compilation from the given
   object files.  This is called automatically for CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE and
   CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY, but can be called manually when using CUDA_WRAP_SRCS
   directly.  When called from CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY or CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE the
   nvcc_flags passed in are the same as the flags passed in via the OPTIONS
   argument.  The only nvcc flag added automatically is the bitness flag as
   specified by CUDA_64_BIT_DEVICE_CODE.  Note that this is a function
   instead of a macro.

CUDA_SELECT_NVCC_ARCH_FLAGS(out_variable [target_CUDA_architectures])
\-\- Selects GPU arch flags for nvcc based on target_CUDA_architectures
   target_CUDA_architectures : Auto | Common | All | LIST(ARCH_AND_PTX ...)
    \- "Auto" detects local machine GPU compute arch at runtime.
    \- "Common" and "All" cover common and entire subsets of architectures
   ARCH_AND_PTX : NAME | NUM.NUM | NUM.NUM(NUM.NUM) | NUM.NUM+PTX
   NAME: Fermi Kepler Maxwell Kepler+Tegra Kepler+Tesla Maxwell+Tegra Pascal
   NUM: Any number. Only those pairs are currently accepted by NVCC though:
         2.0 2.1 3.0 3.2 3.5 3.7 5.0 5.2 5.3 6.0 6.2
   Returns LIST of flags to be added to CUDA_NVCC_FLAGS in ${out_variable}
   Additionally, sets ${out_variable}_readable to the resulting numeric list
   Example:
    CUDA_SELECT_NVCC_ARCH_FLAGS(ARCH_FLAGS 3.0 3.5+PTX 5.2(5.0) Maxwell)
     LIST(APPEND CUDA_NVCC_FLAGS ${ARCH_FLAGS})

   More info on CUDA architectures: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA
   Note that this is a function instead of a macro.

CUDA_WRAP_SRCS ( cuda_target format generated_files file0 file1 ...
                 [STATIC | SHARED | MODULE] [OPTIONS ...] )
\-\- This is where all the magic happens.  CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE,
   CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY, CUDA_COMPILE, and CUDA_COMPILE_PTX all call this
   function under the hood.

   Given the list of files (file0 file1 ... fileN) this macro generates
   custom commands that generate either PTX or linkable objects (use "PTX" or
   "OBJ" for the format argument to switch).  Files that don\(aqt end with .cu
   or have the HEADER_FILE_ONLY property are ignored.

   The arguments passed in after OPTIONS are extra command line options to
   give to nvcc.  You can also specify per configuration options by
   specifying the name of the configuration followed by the options.  General
   options must precede configuration specific options.  Not all
   configurations need to be specified, only the ones provided will be used.

      OPTIONS \-DFLAG=2 "\-DFLAG_OTHER=space in flag"
      DEBUG \-g
      RELEASE \-\-use_fast_math
      RELWITHDEBINFO \-\-use_fast_math;\-g
      MINSIZEREL \-\-use_fast_math

   For certain configurations (namely VS generating object files with
   CUDA_ATTACH_VS_BUILD_RULE_TO_CUDA_FILE set to ON), no generated file will
   be produced for the given cuda file.  This is because when you add the
   cuda file to Visual Studio it knows that this file produces an object file
   and will link in the resulting object file automatically.

   This script will also generate a separate cmake script that is used at
   build time to invoke nvcc.  This is for several reasons.

     1. nvcc can return negative numbers as return values which confuses
     Visual Studio into thinking that the command succeeded.  The script now
     checks the error codes and produces errors when there was a problem.

     2. nvcc has been known to not delete incomplete results when it
     encounters problems.  This confuses build systems into thinking the
     target was generated when in fact an unusable file exists.  The script
     now deletes the output files if there was an error.

     3. By putting all the options that affect the build into a file and then
     make the build rule dependent on the file, the output files will be
     regenerated when the options change.

   This script also looks at optional arguments STATIC, SHARED, or MODULE to
   determine when to target the object compilation for a shared library.
   BUILD_SHARED_LIBS is ignored in CUDA_WRAP_SRCS, but it is respected in
   CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY.  On some systems special flags are added for building
   objects intended for shared libraries.  A preprocessor macro,
   <target_name>_EXPORTS is defined when a shared library compilation is
   detected.

   Flags passed into add_definitions with \-D or /D are passed along to nvcc.

.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B doxygen_add_docs
This function is intended as a convenience for adding a target for generating
documentation with Doxygen. It aims to provide sensible defaults so that
projects can generally just provide the input files and directories and that
will be sufficient to give sensible results. The function supports the
ability to customize the Doxygen configuration used to build the
documentation.
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
doxygen_add_docs(targetName
    [filesOrDirs...]
    [WORKING_DIRECTORY dir]
    [COMMENT comment])
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The function constructs a \fBDoxyfile\fP and defines a custom target that runs
Doxygen on that generated file. The listed files and directories are used as
the \fBINPUT\fP of the generated \fBDoxyfile\fP and they can contain wildcards.
Any files that are listed explicitly will also be added as \fBSOURCES\fP of the
custom target so they will show up in an IDE project\(aqs source list.
.sp
So that relative input paths work as expected, by default the working
directory of the Doxygen command will be the current source directory (i.e.
\fBCMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR\fP). This can be overridden with the
\fBWORKING_DIRECTORY\fP option to change the directory used as the relative
base point. Note also that Doxygen\(aqs default behavior is to strip the working
directory from relative paths in the generated documentation (see the
\fBSTRIP_FROM_PATH\fP \fI\%Doxygen config option\fP for details).
.sp
If provided, the optional \fBcomment\fP will be passed as the \fBCOMMENT\fP for
the \fBadd_custom_target()\fP command used to create the custom target
internally.
.sp
The contents of the generated \fBDoxyfile\fP can be customized by setting CMake
variables before calling \fBdoxygen_add_docs()\fP\&. Any variable with a name of
the form \fBDOXYGEN_<tag>\fP will have its value substituted for the
corresponding \fB<tag>\fP configuration option in the \fBDoxyfile\fP\&. See the
\fI\%Doxygen documentation\fP for the
full list of supported configuration options.
.sp
Some of Doxygen\(aqs defaults are overridden to provide more appropriate
behavior for a CMake project. Each of the following will be explicitly set
unless the variable already has a value before \fBdoxygen_add_docs()\fP is
called (with some exceptions noted):
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B DOXYGEN_HAVE_DOT
Set to \fBYES\fP if the \fBdot\fP component was requested and it was found,
\fBNO\fP otherwise. Any existing value of \fBDOXYGEN_HAVE_DOT\fP is ignored.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B DOXYGEN_DOT_MULTI_TARGETS
Set to \fBYES\fP by this module (note that this requires a \fBdot\fP version
newer than 1.8.10). This option is only meaningful if \fBDOXYGEN_HAVE_DOT\fP
is also set to \fBYES\fP\&.
.UNINDENT

.B DOXYGEN_WARN_FORMAT

the Visual Studio IDE: \fB$file($line) : $text\fP\&. For all other generators,
Doxygen\(aqs default value is not overridden.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 7.0

.B DOXYGEN_PROJECT_NAME

\fBPROJECT_NAME\fP).
.UNINDENT

.B DOXYGEN_PROJECT_NUMBER
Populated with the version of the current project (i.e.
\fBPROJECT_VERSION\fP).
.UNINDENT

.B DOXYGEN_PROJECT_BRIEF
Populated with the description of the current project (i.e.
\fBPROJECT_DESCRIPTION\fP).
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B DOXYGEN_INPUT
Projects should not set this variable. It will be populated with the set of
files and directories passed to \fBdoxygen_add_docs()\fP, thereby providing
consistent behavior with the other built\-in commands like
\fBadd_executable()\fP, \fBadd_library()\fP and
\fBadd_custom_target()\fP\&. If a variable named \fBDOXYGEN_INPUT\fP is set
by the project, it will be ignored and a warning will be issued.

.B DOXYGEN_RECURSIVE

.UNINDENT
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B DOXYGEN_EXCLUDE_PATTERNS
If the set of inputs includes directories, this variable will specify
patterns used to exclude files from them. The following patterns are added
by \fBdoxygen_add_docs()\fP to ensure CMake\-specific files and directories
are not included in the input. If the project sets
\fBDOXYGEN_EXCLUDE_PATTERNS\fP, those contents are merged with these
additional patterns rather than replacing them:

.B DOXYGEN_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
Set to \fBCMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR\fP by this module. Note that if
the project provides its own value for this and it is a relative path, it
will be converted to an absolute path relative to the current binary
directory. This is necessary because doxygen will normally be run from a
directory within the source tree so that relative source paths work as
expected. If this directory does not exist, it will be recursively created
prior to executing the doxygen commands.
.UNINDENT

To change any of these defaults or override any other Doxygen config option,
set relevant variables before calling \fBdoxygen_add_docs()\fP\&. For example:

A number of Doxygen config options accept lists of values, but Doxygen requires
them to be separated by whitespace. CMake variables hold lists as a string with
items separated by semi\-colons, so a conversion needs to be performed. The
\fBdoxygen_add_docs()\fP command specifically checks the following Doxygen config
options and will convert their associated CMake variable\(aqs contents into the
required form if set.

.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B DOXYGEN_EXECUTABLE
The path to the \fBdoxygen\fP command. If projects need to refer to the
\fBdoxygen\fP executable directly, they should use the \fBDoxygen::doxygen\fP
import target instead.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B DOXYGEN_DOT_FOUND
True if the \fBdot\fP executable was found.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B DOXYGEN_DOT_EXECUTABLE
The path to the \fBdot\fP command. If projects need to refer to the \fBdot\fP
executable directly, they should use the \fBDoxygen::dot\fP import target
instead.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B DOXYGEN_DOT_PATH
The path to the directory containing the \fBdot\fP executable as reported in
\fBDOXYGEN_DOT_EXECUTABLE\fP\&. The path may have forward slashes even on Windows
and is not suitable for direct substitution into a \fBDoxyfile.in\fP template.
If you need this value, get the \fBIMPORTED_LOCATION\fP property of the
\fBDoxygen::dot\fP target and use \fBget_filename_component()\fP to extract
the directory part of that path. You may also want to consider using
\fBfile(TO_NATIVE_PATH)\fP to prepare the path for a Doxygen
configuration file.

.SS FindFLEX
.sp

.ft C
FLEX_FOUND \- true is flex executable is found
FLEX_EXECUTABLE \- the path to the flex executable

The minimum required version of flex can be specified using the
standard syntax, e.g.  find_package(FLEX 2.5.13)

.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
FLEX_TARGET(Name FlexInput FlexOutput
            [COMPILE_FLAGS <string>]
            [DEFINES_FILE <string>]
            )
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
which creates a custom command to generate the <FlexOutput> file from
the <FlexInput> file.  If COMPILE_FLAGS option is specified, the next
parameter is added to the flex command line. If flex is configured to
output a header file, the DEFINES_FILE option may be used to specify its
name. Name is an alias used to get details of this custom command.
Indeed the macro defines the following variables:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
FLEX_${Name}_DEFINED \- true is the macro ran successfully
FLEX_${Name}_OUTPUTS \- the source file generated by the custom rule, an

.SS FindHDF5
.sp
Find HDF5, a library for reading and writing self describing array data.
.sp
This module invokes the HDF5 wrapper compiler that should be installed
alongside HDF5.  Depending upon the HDF5 Configuration, the wrapper
compiler is called either h5cc or h5pcc.  If this succeeds, the module
will then call the compiler with the \-show argument to see what flags
are used when compiling an HDF5 client application.
.sp
The module will optionally accept the COMPONENTS argument.  If no
COMPONENTS are specified, then the find module will default to finding
only the HDF5 C library.  If one or more COMPONENTS are specified, the
module will attempt to find the language bindings for the specified
components.  The only valid components are C, CXX, Fortran, HL, and
Fortran_HL.  If the COMPONENTS argument is not given, the module will
attempt to find only the C bindings.
.sp
This module will read the variable
HDF5_USE_STATIC_LIBRARIES to determine whether or not to prefer a
static link to a dynamic link for HDF5 and all of it\(aqs dependencies.
To use this feature, make sure that the HDF5_USE_STATIC_LIBRARIES
variable is set before the call to find_package.
.sp
To provide the module with a hint about where to find your HDF5
installation, you can set the environment variable HDF5_ROOT.  The
Find module will then look in this path when searching for HDF5
executables, paths, and libraries.
.sp
Both the serial and parallel HDF5 wrappers are considered and the first
directory to contain either one will be used.  In the event that both appear
in the same directory the serial version is preferentially selected. This
behavior can be reversed by setting the variable HDF5_PREFER_PARALLEL to
true.
.sp
In addition to finding the includes and libraries required to compile
an HDF5 client application, this module also makes an effort to find
tools that come with the HDF5 distribution that may be useful for
regression testing.
.sp
This module will define the following variables:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

.nf

HDF5_FOUND \- true if HDF5 was found on the system
HDF5_VERSION \- HDF5 version in format Major.Minor.Release

also be defined.  With all components enabled, the following variables will be defined:

.UNINDENT
.sp
Additional information is provided when \fI\%MATLAB_FIND_DEBUG\fP is set.
When a Matlab binary is found automatically and the \fBMATLAB_VERSION\fP
is not given, the version is queried from Matlab directly.
On Windows, it can make a window running Matlab appear.
.sp
The mapping of the release names and the version of Matlab is performed by
defining pairs (name, version).  The variable
\fI\%MATLAB_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS\fP may be provided before the call to
the \fBfind_package()\fP in order to handle additional versions.
.sp
A Matlab scripts can be added to the set of tests using the
\fI\%matlab_add_unit_test()\fP\&. By default, the Matlab unit test framework
will be used (>= 2013a) to run this script, but regular \fB\&.m\fP files
returning an exit code can be used as well (0 indicating a success).

\fBSymbol clash in a MEX target\fP
By default, every symbols inside a MEX
file defined with the command \fI\%matlab_add_mex()\fP have hidden
visibility, except for the entry point. This is the default behaviour of
the MEX compiler, which lowers the risk of symbol collision between the
libraries shipped with Matlab, and the libraries to which the MEX file is
linking to. This is also the default on Windows platforms.
.sp
However, this is not sufficient in certain case, where for instance your
MEX file is linking against libraries that are already loaded by Matlab,
even if those libraries have different SONAMES.
A possible solution is to hide the symbols of the libraries to which the
MEX target is linking to. This can be achieved in GNU GCC compilers with
the linker option \fB\-Wl,\-\-exclude\-libs,ALL\fP\&.
.TP
\fBTests using GPU resources\fP
in case your MEX file is using the GPU and
in order to be able to run unit tests on this MEX file, the GPU resources
should be properly released by Matlab. A possible solution is to make
Matlab aware of the use of the GPU resources in the session, which can be
performed by a command such as \fBD = gpuDevice()\fP at the beginning of
the test script (or via a fixture).

.SS FindMPI
.sp
Find a Message Passing Interface (MPI) implementation.
.sp
The Message Passing Interface (MPI) is a library used to write
high\-performance distributed\-memory parallel applications, and is
typically deployed on a cluster.  MPI is a standard interface (defined
by the MPI forum) for which many implementations are available.
.SS Variables for using MPI
.sp
The module exposes the components \fBC\fP, \fBCXX\fP, \fBMPICXX\fP and \fBFortran\fP\&.
Each of these controls the various MPI languages to search for.
The difference between \fBCXX\fP and \fBMPICXX\fP is that \fBCXX\fP refers to the
MPI C API being usable from C++, whereas \fBMPICXX\fP refers to the MPI\-2 C++ API
that was removed again in MPI\-3.
.sp
Depending on the enabled components the following variables will be set:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBMPI_FOUND\fP
Variable indicating that MPI settings for all requested languages have been found.
If no components are specified, this is true if MPI settings for all enabled languages
were detected. Note that the \fBMPICXX\fP component does not affect this variable.
.TP
.B \fBMPI_VERSION\fP
Minimal version of MPI detected among the requested languages, or all enabled languages
if no components were specified.
.UNINDENT

.SS Variables for locating MPI
.sp
This module performs a three step search for an MPI implementation:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
Check if the compiler has MPI support built\-in. This is the case if the user passed a
compiler wrapper as \fBCMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER\fP or if they\(aqre on a Cray system.
.IP 2. 3
Attempt to find an MPI compiler wrapper and determine the compiler information from it.
.IP 3. 3
Try to find an MPI implementation that does not ship such a wrapper by guessing settings.
Currently, only Microsoft MPI and MPICH2 on Windows are supported.
.UNINDENT
.sp
For controlling the second step, the following variables may be set:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBMPI_<lang>_COMPILER\fP
Search for the specified compiler wrapper and use it.
.TP
.B \fBMPI_<lang>_COMPILER_FLAGS\fP
Flags to pass to the MPI compiler wrapper during interrogation. Some compiler wrappers
support linking debug or tracing libraries if a specific flag is passed and this variable
may be used to obtain them.
.TP
.B \fBMPI_COMPILER_FLAGS\fP
Used to initialize \fBMPI_<lang>_COMPILER_FLAGS\fP if no language specific flag has been given.
Empty by default.
.TP
.B \fBMPI_EXECUTABLE_SUFFIX\fP
A suffix which is appended to all names that are being looked for. For instance you may set this
to \fB\&.mpich\fP or \fB\&.openmpi\fP to prefer the one or the other on Debian and its derivatives.
.UNINDENT
.sp
In order to control the guessing step, the following variable may be set:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBMPI_GUESS_LIBRARY_NAME\fP
Valid values are \fBMSMPI\fP and \fBMPICH2\fP\&. If set, only the given library will be searched for.
By default, \fBMSMPI\fP will be preferred over \fBMPICH2\fP if both are available.
This also sets \fBMPI_SKIP_COMPILER_WRAPPER\fP to \fBtrue\fP, which may be overridden.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Each of the search steps may be skipped with the following control variables:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBMPI_ASSUME_NO_BUILTIN_MPI\fP
If true, the module assumes that the compiler itself does not provide an MPI implementation and
skips to step 2.
.TP
.B \fBMPI_SKIP_COMPILER_WRAPPER\fP
If true, no compiler wrapper will be searched for.
.TP
.B \fBMPI_SKIP_GUESSING\fP
If true, the guessing step will be skipped.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Additionally, the following control variable is available to change search behavior:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBMPI_CXX_SKIP_MPICXX\fP
Add some definitions that will disable the MPI\-2 C++ bindings.
Currently supported are MPICH, Open MPI, Platform MPI and derivatives thereof,
for example MVAPICH or Intel MPI.
.UNINDENT
.sp
If the find procedure fails for a variable \fBMPI_<lang>_WORKS\fP, then the settings detected by or passed to
the module did not work and even a simple MPI test program failed to compile.
.sp
If all of these parameters were not sufficient to find the right MPI implementation, a user may
disable the entire autodetection process by specifying both a list of libraries in \fBMPI_<lang>_LIBRARIES\fP
and a list of include directories in \fBMPI_<lang>_ADDITIONAL_INCLUDE_DIRS\fP\&.
Any other variable may be set in addition to these two. The module will then validate the MPI settings and store the
settings in the cache.
.SS Cache variables for MPI
.sp
The variable \fBMPI_<lang>_INCLUDE_DIRS\fP will be assembled from the following variables.
For C and CXX:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP

.UNINDENT
.sp
For Fortran:
.INDENT 0.0

The variable \fBMPI_<lang>_LIBRARIES\fP will be assembled from the following variables:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBMPI_<lib_name>_LIBRARY\fP
The location of a library called \fB<lib_name>\fP for use with MPI.
.TP
.B \fBMPI_<lang>_LIB_NAMES\fP

.sp
\fBImportant notice:\fP The following checks cannot be performed without \fIexecuting\fP an MPI test program.
Consider the special considerations for the behavior of \fBtry_run()\fP during cross compilation.
Moreover, running an MPI program can cause additional issues, like a firewall notification on some systems.
You should only enable these detections if you absolutely need the information.
.sp
If the following variables are set to true, the respective search will be performed:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBMPI_DETERMINE_Fortran_CAPABILITIES\fP
Determine for all available Fortran bindings what the values of \fBMPI_SUBARRAYS_SUPPORTED\fP and
\fBMPI_ASYNC_PROTECTS_NONBLOCKING\fP are and make their values available as \fBMPI_Fortran_<binding>_SUBARRAYS\fP
and \fBMPI_Fortran_<binding>_ASYNCPROT\fP, where \fB<binding>\fP is one of \fBF77_HEADER\fP, \fBF90_MODULE\fP and
\fBF08_MODULE\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBMPI_DETERMINE_LIBRARY_VERSION\fP
For each language, find the output of \fBMPI_Get_library_version\fP and make it available as \fBMPI_<lang>_LIBRARY_VERSION\fP\&.
This information is usually tied to the runtime component of an MPI implementation and might differ depending on \fB<lang>\fP\&.
Note that the return value is entirely implementation defined. This information might be used to identify
the MPI vendor and for example pick the correct one of multiple third party binaries that matches the MPI vendor.

.UNINDENT
.SS Linux\-specific
.sp
Some Linux systems utilize GLVND as a new ABI for OpenGL.  GLVND separates
context libraries from OpenGL itself; OpenGL lives in "libOpenGL", and
contexts are defined in "libGLX" or "libEGL".  GLVND is currently the only way
to get OpenGL 3+ functionality via EGL in a manner portable across vendors.
Projects may use GLVND explicitly with target \fBOpenGL::OpenGL\fP and either
\fBOpenGL::GLX\fP or \fBOpenGL::EGL\fP\&.
.sp
Projects may use the \fBOpenGL::GL\fP target (or \fBOPENGL_LIBRARIES\fP variable)
to use legacy GL interfaces.  These will use the legacy GL library located
by \fBOPENGL_gl_LIBRARY\fP, if available.  If \fBOPENGL_gl_LIBRARY\fP is empty or
not found and GLVND is available, the \fBOpenGL::GL\fP target will use GLVND
\fBOpenGL::OpenGL\fP and \fBOpenGL::GLX\fP (and the \fBOPENGL_LIBRARIES\fP
variable will use the corresponding libraries).  Thus, for non\-EGL\-based
Linux targets, the \fBOpenGL::GL\fP target is most portable.
.sp
A \fBOpenGL_GL_PREFERENCE\fP variable may be set to specify the preferred way
to provide legacy GL interfaces in case multiple choices are available.
The value may be one of:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBGLVND\fP
If the GLVND OpenGL and GLX libraries are available, prefer them.
This forces \fBOPENGL_gl_LIBRARY\fP to be empty.
This is the default if components were requested (since components
correspond to GLVND libraries).
.TP
.B \fBLEGACY\fP
Prefer to use the legacy libGL library, if available.
This is the default if no components were requested.
.UNINDENT
.sp
For EGL targets the client must rely on GLVND support on the user\(aqs system.
Linking should use the \fBOpenGL::OpenGL OpenGL::EGL\fP targets.  Using GLES*
libraries is theoretically possible in place of \fBOpenGL::OpenGL\fP, but this
module does not currently support that; contributions welcome.
.sp
\fBOPENGL_egl_LIBRARY\fP and \fBOPENGL_EGL_INCLUDE_DIRS\fP are defined in the case of
GLVND.  For non\-GLVND Linux and other systems these are left undefined.
.SS macOS\-Specific

.SS FindOpenThreads
.sp
OpenThreads is a C++ based threading library.  Its largest userbase
seems to OpenSceneGraph so you might notice I accept OSGDIR as an
environment path.  I consider this part of the Findosg* suite used to
find OpenSceneGraph components.  Each component is separate and you
must opt in to each module.

OPENTHREADS_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find the headers
.sp
$OPENTHREADS_DIR is an environment variable that would correspond to
the ./configure \-\-prefix=$OPENTHREADS_DIR used in building osg.

be used as well to influence detection, instead of needing to specify
an environment variable.

control over your own system piece by piece in case you need to opt
out of certain components or change the Find behavior for a particular
module (perhaps because the default FindOpenGL.cmake module doesn\(aqt
work with your system as an example).  If you want to use a more

This module provides a function intended to be used in Find Modules
implementing \fBfind_package(<PackageName>)\fP calls.  It handles the
\fBREQUIRED\fP, \fBQUIET\fP and version\-related arguments of \fBfind_package\fP\&.
It also sets the \fB<PackageName>_FOUND\fP variable.  The package is
considered found if all variables listed contain valid results, e.g.
valid filepaths.

The \fB<PackageName>_FOUND\fP variable will be set to \fBTRUE\fP if all
the variables \fB<required\-var>...\fP are valid and any optional
constraints are satisfied, and \fBFALSE\fP otherwise.  A success or
failure message may be displayed based on the results and on
whether the \fBREQUIRED\fP and/or \fBQUIET\fP option was given to
the \fBfind_package()\fP call.
.sp
The options are:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fB(DEFAULT_MSG|<custom\-failure\-message>)\fP
In the simple signature this specifies the failure message.
Use \fBDEFAULT_MSG\fP to ask for a default message to be computed
(recommended).  Not valid in the full signature.
.TP
.B \fBFOUND_VAR <result\-var>\fP
Obsolete.  Specifies either \fB<PackageName>_FOUND\fP or
\fB<PACKAGENAME>_FOUND\fP as the result variable.  This exists only
for compatibility with older versions of CMake and is now ignored.
Result variables of both names are always set for compatibility.
.TP
.B \fBREQUIRED_VARS <required\-var>...\fP
Specify the variables which are required for this package.
These may be named in the generated failure message asking the
user to set the missing variable values.  Therefore these should
typically be cache entries such as \fBFOO_LIBRARY\fP and not output
variables like \fBFOO_LIBRARIES\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBVERSION_VAR <version\-var>\fP
Specify the name of a variable that holds the version of the package
that has been found.  This version will be checked against the
(potentially) specified required version given to the
\fBfind_package()\fP call, including its \fBEXACT\fP option.
The default messages include information about the required
version and the version which has been actually found, both
if the version is ok or not.
.TP
.B \fBHANDLE_COMPONENTS\fP
Enable handling of package components.  In this case, the command
will report which components have been found and which are missing,
and the \fB<PackageName>_FOUND\fP variable will be set to \fBFALSE\fP
if any of the required components (i.e. not the ones listed after
the \fBOPTIONAL_COMPONENTS\fP option of \fBfind_package()\fP) are
missing.
.TP
.B \fBCONFIG_MODE\fP
Specify that the calling find module is a wrapper around a
call to \fBfind_package(<PackageName> NO_MODULE)\fP\&.  This implies
a \fBVERSION_VAR\fP value of \fB<PackageName>_VERSION\fP\&.  The command
will automatically check whether the package configuration file
was found.
.TP
.B \fBFAIL_MESSAGE <custom\-failure\-message>\fP
Specify a custom failure message instead of using the default
generated message.  Not recommended.

The \fBLibXml2\fP package is considered to be found if both
\fBLIBXML2_LIBRARY\fP and \fBLIBXML2_INCLUDE_DIR\fP are valid.
Then also \fBLibXml2_FOUND\fP is set to \fBTRUE\fP\&.  If it is not found
and \fBREQUIRED\fP was used, it fails with a
\fBmessage(FATAL_ERROR)\fP, independent whether \fBQUIET\fP was
used or not.  If it is found, success will be reported, including
the content of the first \fB<required\-var>\fP\&.  On repeated CMake runs,
the same message will not be printed again.

In this case, the \fBLibArchive\fP package is considered to be found if

the default messages will be printed.

\fBfind_package_handle_standard_args\fP produces a proper success/failure

.SS FindPackageMessage
.sp
FIND_PACKAGE_MESSAGE(<name> "message for user" "find result details")
.sp
This macro is intended to be used in FindXXX.cmake modules files.  It
will print a message once for each unique find result.  This is useful
for telling the user where a package was found.  The first argument
specifies the name (XXX) of the package.  The second argument
specifies the message to display.  The third argument lists details
about the find result so that if they change the message will be
displayed again.  The macro also obeys the QUIET argument to the
find_package command.

Each component is separate and you must opt in to each module.  You
must also opt into OpenGL (and OpenThreads?) as these modules won\(aqt do
it for you.  This is to allow you control over your own system piece

the Find behavior for a particular module (perhaps because the default
FindOpenGL.cmake module doesn\(aqt work with your system as an example).
If you want to use a more convenient module that includes everything,

modules.

macro QT4_AUTOMOC(sourcefile1 sourcefile2 ... [TARGET tgt])
      The qt4_automoc macro is obsolete.  Use the CMAKE_AUTOMOC feature instead.
      This macro is still experimental.
      It can be used to have moc automatically handled.
      So if you have the files foo.h and foo.cpp, and in foo.h a
      a class uses the Q_OBJECT macro, moc has to run on it. If you don\(aqt
      want to use QT4_WRAP_CPP() (which is reliable and mature), you can insert
      #include "foo.moc"
      in foo.cpp and then give foo.cpp as argument to QT4_AUTOMOC(). This will
      scan all listed files at cmake\-time for such included moc files and if it
      finds them cause a rule to be generated to run moc at build time on the
      accompanying header file foo.h.
      If a source file has the SKIP_AUTOMOC property set it will be ignored by
      this macro.
      If the <tgt> is specified, the INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES and
      INTERFACE_COMPILE_DEFINITIONS from the <tgt> are passed to moc.

       This function is obsolete. Use target_link_libraries with IMPORTED targets

       Make <target> use the <modules> from Qt. Using a Qt module means
       to link to the library, add the relevant include directories for the
       module, and add the relevant compiler defines for using the module.
       Modules are roughly equivalent to components of Qt4, so usage would be
       something like:
        qt4_use_modules(myexe Core Gui Declarative)
       to use QtCore, QtGui and QtDeclarative. The optional <link_type> argument
       can be specified as either LINK_PUBLIC or LINK_PRIVATE to specify the

OS X framework based version.  (Other versions link to \-lSDLmain which
this module will try to find on your behalf.) Also for OS X, this
module will automatically add the \-framework Cocoa on your behalf.
.sp
Additional Note: If you see an empty SDL_LIBRARY_TEMP in your
configuration and no SDL_LIBRARY, it means CMake did not find your SDL
library (SDL.dll, libsdl.so, SDL.framework, etc).  Set
SDL_LIBRARY_TEMP to point to your SDL library, and configure again.
Similarly, if you see an empty SDLMAIN_LIBRARY, you should set this
value as appropriate.  These values are used to generate the final
SDL_LIBRARY variable, but when these values are unset, SDL_LIBRARY
does not get created.
.sp
$SDLDIR is an environment variable that would correspond to the
./configure \-\-prefix=$SDLDIR used in building SDL.  l.e.galup 9\-20\-02
.sp
Modified by Eric Wing.  Added code to assist with automated building
by using environmental variables and providing a more
controlled/consistent search behavior.  Added new modifications to
recognize OS X frameworks and additional Unix paths (FreeBSD, etc).
Also corrected the header search path to follow "proper" SDL
guidelines.  Added a search for SDLmain which is needed by some
platforms.  Added a search for threads which is needed by some
platforms.  Added needed compile switches for MinGW.
.sp
On OSX, this will prefer the Framework version (if found) over others.
People will have to manually change the cache values of SDL_LIBRARY to
override this selection or set the CMake environment
CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH to modify the search paths.
.sp
Note that the header path has changed from SDL/SDL.h to just SDL.h
This needed to change because "proper" SDL convention is #include
"SDL.h", not <SDL/SDL.h>.  This is done for portability reasons
because not all systems place things in SDL/ (see FreeBSD).

Typically, you should not use these variables directly, and you should
use SDL_SOUND_LIBRARIES which contains SDL_SOUND_LIBRARY and the other
audio libraries (if needed) to successfully compile on your system.
.sp
Created by Eric Wing.  This module is a bit more complicated than the
other FindSDL* family modules.  The reason is that SDL_sound can be
compiled in a large variety of different ways which are independent of
platform.  SDL_sound may dynamically link against other 3rd party
libraries to get additional codec support, such as Ogg Vorbis, SMPEG,
ModPlug, MikMod, FLAC, Speex, and potentially others.  Under some
circumstances which I don\(aqt fully understand, there seems to be a
requirement that dependent libraries of libraries you use must also be
explicitly linked against in order to successfully compile.  SDL_sound
does not currently have any system in place to know how it was
compiled.  So this CMake module does the hard work in trying to
discover which 3rd party libraries are required for building (if any).
This module uses a brute force approach to create a test program that
uses SDL_sound, and then tries to build it.  If the build fails, it
parses the error output for known symbol names to figure out which
libraries are needed.
.sp
Responds to the $SDLDIR and $SDLSOUNDDIR environmental variable that
would correspond to the ./configure \-\-prefix=$SDLDIR used in building
SDL.

On OSX, this will prefer the Framework version (if found) over others.
People will have to manually change the cache values of SDL_LIBRARY to

.B FortranCInterface_HEADER
The \fBFortranCInterface_HEADER\fP function is provided to generate a
C header file containing macros to mangle symbol names:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
FortranCInterface_HEADER(<file>
                         [MACRO_NAMESPACE <macro\-ns>]

.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT

.ft C
#define FortranCInterface_GLOBAL (name,NAME) ...
#define FortranCInterface_GLOBAL_(name,NAME) ...
#define FortranCInterface_MODULE (mod,name, MOD,NAME) ...
#define FortranCInterface_MODULE_(mod,name, MOD,NAME) ...
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
These macros mangle four categories of Fortran symbols, respectively:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
Global symbols without \(aq_\(aq: \fBcall mysub()\fP
.IP \(bu 2
Global symbols with \(aq_\(aq   : \fBcall my_sub()\fP
.IP \(bu 2
Module symbols without \(aq_\(aq: \fBuse mymod; call mysub()\fP
.IP \(bu 2
Module symbols with \(aq_\(aq   : \fBuse mymod; call my_sub()\fP
.UNINDENT
.sp
If mangling for a category is not known, its macro is left undefined.
All macros require raw names in both lower case and upper case.
.sp
The options are:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fBMACRO_NAMESPACE\fP
Replace the default \fBFortranCInterface_\fP prefix with a given
namespace \fB<macro\-ns>\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBSYMBOLS\fP
List symbols to mangle automatically with C preprocessor definitions:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
<function>          ==> #define <ns><function> ...
<module>:<function> ==> #define <ns><module>_<function> ...
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If the mangling for some symbol is not known then no preprocessor
definition is created, and a warning is displayed.
.TP
.B \fBSYMBOL_NAMESPACE\fP
Prefix all preprocessor definitions generated by the \fBSYMBOLS\fP
option with a given namespace \fB<ns>\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B FortranCInterface_VERIFY

.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
FortranCInterface_VERIFY([CXX] [QUIET])
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
It tests whether a simple test executable using Fortran and C (and C++
when the CXX option is given) compiles and links successfully.  The
result is stored in the cache entry \fBFortranCInterface_VERIFIED_C\fP
(or \fBFortranCInterface_VERIFIED_CXX\fP if \fBCXX\fP is given) as a boolean.
If the check fails and \fBQUIET\fP is not given the function terminates with a
fatal error message describing the problem.  The purpose of this check
is to stop a build early for incompatible compiler combinations.  The
test is built in the \fBRelease\fP configuration.

.SS GenerateExportHeader
.sp
Function for generation of export macros for libraries
.sp
This module provides the function GENERATE_EXPORT_HEADER().
.sp
The \fBGENERATE_EXPORT_HEADER\fP function can be used to generate a file
suitable for preprocessor inclusion which contains EXPORT macros to be
used in library classes:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
GENERATE_EXPORT_HEADER( LIBRARY_TARGET
          [BASE_NAME <base_name>]

          [EXPORT_FILE_NAME <export_file_name>]
          [DEPRECATED_MACRO_NAME <deprecated_macro_name>]
          [NO_EXPORT_MACRO_NAME <no_export_macro_name>]
          [STATIC_DEFINE <static_define>]
          [NO_DEPRECATED_MACRO_NAME <no_deprecated_macro_name>]
          [DEFINE_NO_DEPRECATED]

.sp
The target properties \fBCXX_VISIBILITY_PRESET\fP
and \fBVISIBILITY_INLINES_HIDDEN\fP can be used to add the appropriate
compile flags for targets.  See the documentation of those target properties,
and the convenience variables
\fBCMAKE_CXX_VISIBILITY_PRESET\fP and
\fBCMAKE_VISIBILITY_INLINES_HIDDEN\fP\&.
.sp
By default \fBGENERATE_EXPORT_HEADER()\fP generates macro names in a file
name determined by the name of the library.  This means that in the
simplest case, users of \fBGenerateExportHeader\fP will be equivalent to:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
set(CMAKE_CXX_VISIBILITY_PRESET hidden)
set(CMAKE_VISIBILITY_INLINES_HIDDEN 1)
add_library(somelib someclass.cpp)
generate_export_header(somelib)
install(TARGETS somelib DESTINATION ${LIBRARY_INSTALL_DIR})
install(FILES
 someclass.h
 ${PROJECT_BINARY_DIR}/somelib_export.h DESTINATION ${INCLUDE_INSTALL_DIR}
)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
And in the ABI header files:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

.nf
.ft C
#include "somelib_export.h"
class SOMELIB_EXPORT SomeClass {
  ...
};
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The CMake fragment will generate a file in the
\fB${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}\fP called \fBsomelib_export.h\fP containing the
macros \fBSOMELIB_EXPORT\fP, \fBSOMELIB_NO_EXPORT\fP, \fBSOMELIB_DEPRECATED\fP,
\fBSOMELIB_DEPRECATED_EXPORT\fP and \fBSOMELIB_DEPRECATED_NO_EXPORT\fP\&.
They will be followed by content taken from the variable specified by
the \fBCUSTOM_CONTENT_FROM_VARIABLE\fP option, if any.
The resulting file should be installed with other headers in the library.
.sp
The \fBBASE_NAME\fP argument can be used to override the file name and the
names used for the macros:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
add_library(somelib someclass.cpp)
generate_export_header(somelib
  BASE_NAME other_name
)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Generates a file called \fBother_name_export.h\fP containing the macros
\fBOTHER_NAME_EXPORT\fP, \fBOTHER_NAME_NO_EXPORT\fP and \fBOTHER_NAME_DEPRECATED\fP
etc.
.sp
The \fBBASE_NAME\fP may be overridden by specifying other options in the
function.  For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
add_library(somelib someclass.cpp)
generate_export_header(somelib
  EXPORT_MACRO_NAME OTHER_NAME_EXPORT
)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp

.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
add_library(somelib someclass.cpp)
generate_export_header(somelib
  DEPRECATED_MACRO_NAME KDE_DEPRECATED
)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
creates the macro \fBKDE_DEPRECATED\fP instead of \fBSOMELIB_DEPRECATED\fP\&.
.sp
If \fBLIBRARY_TARGET\fP is a static library, macros are defined without
values.
.sp
If the same sources are used to create both a shared and a static
library, the uppercased symbol \fB${BASE_NAME}_STATIC_DEFINE\fP should be
used when building the static library:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
add_library(shared_variant SHARED ${lib_SRCS})
add_library(static_variant ${lib_SRCS})

set_target_properties(static_variant PROPERTIES
  COMPILE_FLAGS \-DLIBSHARED_AND_STATIC_STATIC_DEFINE)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This will cause the export macros to expand to nothing when building
the static library.
.sp
If \fBDEFINE_NO_DEPRECATED\fP is specified, then a macro
\fB${BASE_NAME}_NO_DEPRECATED\fP will be defined This macro can be used to
remove deprecated code from preprocessor output:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
option(EXCLUDE_DEPRECATED "Exclude deprecated parts of the library" FALSE)
if (EXCLUDE_DEPRECATED)

endif()
generate_export_header(somelib ${NO_BUILD_DEPRECATED})
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
And then in somelib:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
class SOMELIB_EXPORT SomeClass
{
public:
#ifndef SOMELIB_NO_DEPRECATED

.SS GoogleTest
.sp
This module defines functions to help use the Google Test infrastructure.  Two
mechanisms for adding tests are provided. \fI\%gtest_add_tests()\fP has been
around for some time, originally via \fBfind_package(GTest)\fP\&.
\fI\%gtest_discover_tests()\fP was introduced in CMake 3.10.
.sp
The (older) \fI\%gtest_add_tests()\fP scans source files to identify tests.
This is usually effective, with some caveats, including in cross\-compiling
environments, and makes setting additional properties on tests more convenient.
However, its handling of parameterized tests is less comprehensive, and it
requires re\-running CMake to detect changes to the list of tests.
.sp
The (newer) \fI\%gtest_discover_tests()\fP discovers tests by asking the
compiled test executable to enumerate its tests.  This is more robust and
provides better handling of parameterized tests, and does not require CMake
to be re\-run when tests change.  However, it may not work in a cross\-compiling
environment, and setting test properties is less convenient.
.sp
More details can be found in the documentation of the respective functions.
.sp
Both commands are intended to replace use of \fBadd_test()\fP to register
tests, and will create a separate CTest test for each Google Test test case.
Note that this is in some cases less efficient, as common set\-up and tear\-down
logic cannot be shared by multiple test cases executing in the same instance.
However, it provides more fine\-grained pass/fail information to CTest, which is
usually considered as more beneficial.  By default, the CTest test name is the
same as the Google Test name (i.e. \fBsuite.testcase\fP); see also
\fBTEST_PREFIX\fP and \fBTEST_SUFFIX\fP\&.

.UNINDENT

.sp
\fBgtest_add_tests\fP attempts to identify tests by scanning source files.
Although this is generally effective, it uses only a basic regular expression
match, which can be defeated by atypical test declarations, and is unable to
fully "split" parameterized tests.  Additionally, it requires that CMake be
re\-run to discover any newly added, removed or renamed tests (by default,
this means that CMake is re\-run when any test source file is changed, but see
\fBSKIP_DEPENDENCY\fP).  However, it has the advantage of declaring tests at
CMake time, which somewhat simplifies setting additional properties on tests,
and always works in a cross\-compiling environment.
.sp
The options are:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fBTARGET target\fP
Specifies the Google Test executable, which must be a known CMake
executable target.  CMake will substitute the location of the built
executable when running the test.
.TP
.B \fBSOURCES src1...\fP
When provided, only the listed files will be scanned for test cases.  If
this option is not given, the \fBSOURCES\fP property of the
specified \fBtarget\fP will be used to obtain the list of sources.
.TP
.B \fBEXTRA_ARGS arg1...\fP
Any extra arguments to pass on the command line to each test case.
.TP
.B \fBWORKING_DIRECTORY dir\fP
Specifies the directory in which to run the discovered test cases.  If this
option is not provided, the current binary directory is used.
.TP
.B \fBTEST_PREFIX prefix\fP
Specifies a \fBprefix\fP to be prepended to the name of each discovered test
case.  This can be useful when the same source files are being used in
multiple calls to \fBgtest_add_test()\fP but with different \fBEXTRA_ARGS\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBTEST_SUFFIX suffix\fP
Similar to \fBTEST_PREFIX\fP except the \fBsuffix\fP is appended to the name of
every discovered test case.  Both \fBTEST_PREFIX\fP and \fBTEST_SUFFIX\fP may
be specified.
.TP
.B \fBSKIP_DEPENDENCY\fP
Normally, the function creates a dependency which will cause CMake to be
re\-run if any of the sources being scanned are changed.  This is to ensure
that the list of discovered tests is updated.  If this behavior is not
desired (as may be the case while actually writing the test cases), this
option can be used to prevent the dependency from being added.
.TP
.B \fBTEST_LIST outVar\fP
The variable named by \fBoutVar\fP will be populated in the calling scope
with the list of discovered test cases.  This allows the caller to do
things like manipulate test properties of the discovered tests.

\fBgtest_discover_tests\fP sets up a post\-build command on the test executable
that generates the list of tests by parsing the output from running the test
with the \fB\-\-gtest_list_tests\fP argument.  Compared to the source parsing
approach of \fI\%gtest_add_tests()\fP, this ensures that the full list of
tests, including instantiations of parameterized tests, is obtained.  Since
test discovery occurs at build time, it is not necessary to re\-run CMake when
the list of tests changes.
However, it requires that \fBCROSSCOMPILING_EMULATOR\fP is properly set
in order to function in a cross\-compiling environment.
.sp
Additionally, setting properties on tests is somewhat less convenient, since
the tests are not available at CMake time.  Additional test properties may be
assigned to the set of tests as a whole using the \fBPROPERTIES\fP option.  If
more fine\-grained test control is needed, custom content may be provided
through an external CTest script using the \fBTEST_INCLUDE_FILES\fP
directory property.  The set of discovered tests is made accessible to such a
script via the \fB<target>_TESTS\fP variable.
.sp
The options are:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fBtarget\fP
Specifies the Google Test executable, which must be a known CMake
executable target.  CMake will substitute the location of the built
executable when running the test.
.TP
.B \fBEXTRA_ARGS arg1...\fP
Any extra arguments to pass on the command line to each test case.
.TP
.B \fBWORKING_DIRECTORY dir\fP
Specifies the directory in which to run the discovered test cases.  If this
option is not provided, the current binary directory is used.
.TP
.B \fBTEST_PREFIX prefix\fP
Specifies a \fBprefix\fP to be prepended to the name of each discovered test
case.  This can be useful when the same test executable is being used in
multiple calls to \fBgtest_discover_tests()\fP but with different
\fBEXTRA_ARGS\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBTEST_SUFFIX suffix\fP
Similar to \fBTEST_PREFIX\fP except the \fBsuffix\fP is appended to the name of
every discovered test case.  Both \fBTEST_PREFIX\fP and \fBTEST_SUFFIX\fP may
be specified.
.TP
.B \fBNO_PRETTY_TYPES\fP
By default, the type index of type\-parameterized tests is replaced by the
actual type name in the CTest test name.  If this behavior is undesirable
(e.g. because the type names are unwieldy), this option will suppress this
behavior.
.TP
.B \fBNO_PRETTY_VALUES\fP
By default, the value index of value\-parameterized tests is replaced by the
actual value in the CTest test name.  If this behavior is undesirable
(e.g. because the value strings are unwieldy), this option will suppress
this behavior.
.TP
.B \fBPROPERTIES name1 value1...\fP
Specifies additional properties to be set on all tests discovered by this
invocation of \fBgtest_discover_tests\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBTEST_LIST var\fP
Make the list of tests available in the variable \fBvar\fP, rather than the
default \fB<target>_TESTS\fP\&.  This can be useful when the same test
executable is being used in multiple calls to \fBgtest_discover_tests()\fP\&.
Note that this variable is only available in CTest.
.TP
.B \fBTIMEOUT num\fP
Specifies how long (in seconds) CMake will wait for the test to enumerate
available tests.  If the test takes longer than this, discovery (and your
build) will fail.  Most test executables will enumerate their tests very
quickly, but under some exceptional circumstances, a test may require a
longer timeout.  The default is 5.  See also the \fBTIMEOUT\fP option of
\fBexecute_process()\fP\&.

.SS InstallRequiredSystemLibraries

Include this module to search for compiler\-provided system runtime
libraries and add install rules for them.  Some optional variables

.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBCMAKE_INSTALL_SYSTEM_RUNTIME_LIBS\fP
Specify additional runtime libraries that may not be detected.
After inclusion any detected libraries will be appended to this.
.TP
.B \fBCMAKE_INSTALL_SYSTEM_RUNTIME_LIBS_SKIP\fP
Set to TRUE to skip calling the \fBinstall(PROGRAMS)\fP command to
allow the includer to specify its own install rule, using the value of
\fBCMAKE_INSTALL_SYSTEM_RUNTIME_LIBS\fP to get the list of libraries.
.TP
.B \fBCMAKE_INSTALL_DEBUG_LIBRARIES\fP
Set to TRUE to install the debug runtime libraries when available
with MSVC tools.
.TP
.B \fBCMAKE_INSTALL_DEBUG_LIBRARIES_ONLY\fP
Set to TRUE to install only the debug runtime libraries with MSVC
tools even if the release runtime libraries are also available.
.TP
.B \fBCMAKE_INSTALL_UCRT_LIBRARIES\fP
Set to TRUE to install the Windows Universal CRT libraries for
app\-local deployment (e.g. to Windows XP).  This is meaningful
only with MSVC from Visual Studio 2015 or higher.
.sp
One may set a \fBCMAKE_WINDOWS_KITS_10_DIR\fP \fIenvironment variable\fP
to an absolute path to tell CMake to look for Windows 10 SDKs in
a custom location.  The specified directory is expected to contain
\fBRedist/ucrt/DLLs/*\fP directories.
.TP
.B \fBCMAKE_INSTALL_MFC_LIBRARIES\fP
Set to TRUE to install the MSVC MFC runtime libraries.
.TP
.B \fBCMAKE_INSTALL_OPENMP_LIBRARIES\fP
Set to TRUE to install the MSVC OpenMP runtime libraries
.TP
.B \fBCMAKE_INSTALL_SYSTEM_RUNTIME_DESTINATION\fP
Specify the \fBinstall(PROGRAMS)\fP command \fBDESTINATION\fP
option.  If not specified, the default is \fBbin\fP on Windows
and \fBlib\fP elsewhere.
.TP
.B \fBCMAKE_INSTALL_SYSTEM_RUNTIME_LIBS_NO_WARNINGS\fP
Set to TRUE to disable warnings about required library files that
do not exist.  (For example, Visual Studio Express editions may
not provide the redistributable files.)
.TP
.B \fBCMAKE_INSTALL_SYSTEM_RUNTIME_COMPONENT\fP
Specify the \fBinstall(PROGRAMS)\fP command \fBCOMPONENT\fP
option.  If not specified, no such option will be used.

MACRO_ADD_FILE_DEPENDENCIES(<_file> depend_files...)
.sp
Using the macro MACRO_ADD_FILE_DEPENDENCIES() is discouraged.  There
are usually better ways to specify the correct dependencies.
.sp
MACRO_ADD_FILE_DEPENDENCIES(<_file> depend_files...) is just a
convenience wrapper around the OBJECT_DEPENDS source file property.
You can just use set_property(SOURCE <file> APPEND PROPERTY
OBJECT_DEPENDS depend_files) instead.
.SS ProcessorCount
.sp
ProcessorCount(var)
.sp
Determine the number of processors/cores and save value in ${var}
.sp
Sets the variable named ${var} to the number of physical cores
available on the machine if the information can be determined.
Otherwise it is set to 0.  Currently this functionality is implemented
for AIX, cygwin, FreeBSD, HPUX, IRIX, Linux, Mac OS X, QNX, Sun and
Windows.
.sp
This function is guaranteed to return a positive integer (>=1) if it
succeeds.  It returns 0 if there\(aqs a problem determining the processor
count.
.sp

.INDENT 0.0

This function is intended to offer an approximation of the value of
the number of compute cores available on the current machine, such
that you may use that value for parallel building and parallel
testing.  It is meant to help utilize as much of the machine as seems
reasonable.  Of course, knowledge of what else might be running on the
machine simultaneously should be used when deciding whether to request
a machine\(aqs full capacity all for yourself.
.SS SelectLibraryConfigurations
.sp
select_library_configurations( basename )
.sp
This macro takes a library base name as an argument, and will choose
good values for basename_LIBRARY, basename_LIBRARIES,
basename_LIBRARY_DEBUG, and basename_LIBRARY_RELEASE depending on what
has been found and set.  If only basename_LIBRARY_RELEASE is defined,
basename_LIBRARY will be set to the release value, and
basename_LIBRARY_DEBUG will be set to basename_LIBRARY_DEBUG\-NOTFOUND.
If only basename_LIBRARY_DEBUG is defined, then basename_LIBRARY will
take the debug value, and basename_LIBRARY_RELEASE will be set to
basename_LIBRARY_RELEASE\-NOTFOUND.
.sp
If the generator supports configuration types, then basename_LIBRARY
and basename_LIBRARIES will be set with debug and optimized flags
specifying the library to be used for the given configuration.  If no
build type has been set or the generator in use does not support
configuration types, then basename_LIBRARY and basename_LIBRARIES will
take only the release value, or the debug value if the release one is
not set.
.SS SquishTestScript
.sp
This script launches a GUI test using Squish.  You should not call the
script directly; instead, you should access it via the SQUISH_ADD_TEST
macro that is defined in FindSquish.cmake.
.sp
This script starts the Squish server, launches the test on the client,
and finally stops the squish server.  If any of these steps fail
(including if the tests do not pass) then a fatal error is raised.

source files (source) and adds the given resource files (resource) to
the jar file.  Source files can be java files or listing files
(prefixed by \(aq@\(aq).  If only resource files are given then just a jar file
is created.  The list of include jars are added to the classpath when
compiling the java sources and also to the dependencies of the target.
INCLUDE_JARS also accepts other target names created by add_jar.  For
backwards compatibility, jar files listed as sources are ignored (as

The \fBwrite_compiler_detection_header\fP function generates the
file \fB<file>\fP with macros which all have the prefix \fB<prefix>\fP\&.
.sp
By default, all content is written directly to the \fB<file>\fP\&.  The
\fBOUTPUT_FILES_VAR\fP may be specified to cause the compiler\-specific
content to be written to separate files.  The separate files are then
available in the \fB<output_files_var>\fP and may be consumed by the caller
for installation for example.  The \fBOUTPUT_DIR\fP specifies a relative
path from the main \fB<file>\fP to the compiler\-specific files. For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

\fBVERSION\fP may be used to specify the API version to be generated.
Future versions of CMake may introduce alternative APIs.  A given
API is selected by any \fB<version>\fP value greater than or equal
to the version of CMake that introduced the given API and less
than the version of CMake that introduced its succeeding API.
The value of the \fBCMAKE_MINIMUM_REQUIRED_VERSION\fP
variable is used if no explicit version is specified.
(As of CMake version 3.10.1 there is only one API version.)
.sp
\fBPROLOG\fP may be specified as text content to write at the start of the
header. \fBEPILOG\fP may be specified as text content to write at the end
of the header
.sp
At least one \fB<compiler>\fP and one \fB<feature>\fP must be listed.  Compilers
which are known to CMake, but not specified are detected and a preprocessor
\fB#error\fP is generated for them.  A preprocessor macro matching
\fB<PREFIX>_COMPILER_IS_<compiler>\fP is generated for each compiler
known to CMake to contain the value \fB0\fP or \fB1\fP\&.
.sp
Possible compiler identifiers are documented with the
\fBCMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_ID\fP variable.
Available features in this version of CMake are listed in the
\fBCMAKE_C_KNOWN_FEATURES\fP and
\fBCMAKE_CXX_KNOWN_FEATURES\fP global properties.
The \fB{c,cxx}_std_*\fP meta\-features are ignored if requested.
.sp
See the \fBcmake\-compile\-features(7)\fP manual for information on
compile features.
.sp
\fBALLOW_UNKNOWN_COMPILERS\fP and \fBALLOW_UNKNOWN_COMPILER_VERSIONS\fP cause
the module to generate conditions that treat unknown compilers as simply
lacking all features.  Without these options the default behavior is to
generate a \fB#error\fP for unknown compilers.
.SS Feature Test Macros
.sp
For each compiler, a preprocessor macro is generated matching
\fB<PREFIX>_COMPILER_IS_<compiler>\fP which has the content either \fB0\fP
or \fB1\fP, depending on the compiler in use. Preprocessor macros for
compiler version components are generated matching
\fB<PREFIX>_COMPILER_VERSION_MAJOR\fP \fB<PREFIX>_COMPILER_VERSION_MINOR\fP
and \fB<PREFIX>_COMPILER_VERSION_PATCH\fP containing decimal values
for the corresponding compiler version components, if defined.
.sp
A preprocessor test is generated based on the compiler version
denoting whether each feature is enabled.  A preprocessor macro
matching \fB<PREFIX>_COMPILER_<FEATURE>\fP, where \fB<FEATURE>\fP is the
upper\-case \fB<feature>\fP name, is generated to contain the value
\fB0\fP or \fB1\fP depending on whether the compiler in use supports the
feature:

.SS Compatibility Implementation Macros
.sp
Some features are suitable for wrapping in a macro with a backward
compatibility implementation if the compiler does not support the feature.
.sp
When the \fBcxx_static_assert\fP feature is not provided by the compiler,
a compatibility implementation is available via the
\fB<PREFIX>_STATIC_ASSERT(COND)\fP and
\fB<PREFIX>_STATIC_ASSERT_MSG(COND, MSG)\fP function\-like macros. The macros
expand to \fBstatic_assert\fP where that compiler feature is available, and
to a compatibility implementation otherwise. In the first form, the
condition is stringified in the message field of \fBstatic_assert\fP\&.  In
the second form, the message \fBMSG\fP is passed to the message field of
\fBstatic_assert\fP, or ignored if using the backward compatibility
implementation.
.sp
The \fBcxx_attribute_deprecated\fP feature provides a macro definition
\fB<PREFIX>_DEPRECATED\fP, which expands to either the standard
\fB[[deprecated]]\fP attribute or a compiler\-specific decorator such
as \fB__attribute__((__deprecated__))\fP used by GNU compilers.
.sp
The \fBcxx_alignas\fP feature provides a macro definition
\fB<PREFIX>_ALIGNAS\fP which expands to either the standard \fBalignas\fP
decorator or a compiler\-specific decorator such as
\fB__attribute__ ((__aligned__))\fP used by GNU compilers.
.sp
The \fBcxx_alignof\fP feature provides a macro definition
\fB<PREFIX>_ALIGNOF\fP which expands to either the standard \fBalignof\fP
decorator or a compiler\-specific decorator such as \fB__alignof__\fP
used by GNU compilers.

A use\-case which arises with such deprecation macros is the deprecation
of an entire library.  In that case, all public API in the library may
be decorated with the \fB<PREFIX>_DEPRECATED\fP macro.  This results in
very noisy build output when building the library itself, so the macro
may be may be defined to empty in that case when building the deprecated
