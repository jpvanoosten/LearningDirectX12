.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
The "ccmake" executable is the CMake curses interface.  Project
configuration settings may be specified interactively through this
GUI.  Brief instructions are provided at the bottom of the terminal
when the program is running.
.sp
CMake is a cross\-platform build system generator.  Projects specify
their build process with platform\-independent CMake listfiles included
in each directory of a source tree with the name CMakeLists.txt.
Users build a project by using CMake to generate a build system for a
native tool on their platform.
.SH OPTIONS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB\-C <initial\-cache>\fP
Pre\-load a script to populate the cache.
.sp
When cmake is first run in an empty build tree, it creates a
CMakeCache.txt file and populates it with customizable settings for
the project.  This option may be used to specify a file from which
to load cache entries before the first pass through the project\(aqs
cmake listfiles.  The loaded entries take priority over the
project\(aqs default values.  The given file should be a CMake script
containing SET commands that use the CACHE option, not a
cache\-format file.
.TP
.B \fB\-D <var>:<type>=<value>, \-D <var>=<value>\fP
Create a cmake cache entry.
.sp
When cmake is first run in an empty build tree, it creates a
CMakeCache.txt file and populates it with customizable settings for
the project.  This option may be used to specify a setting that
takes priority over the project\(aqs default value.  The option may be
repeated for as many cache entries as desired.
.sp
If the \fB:<type>\fP portion is given it must be one of the types
specified by the \fBset()\fP command documentation for its
\fBCACHE\fP signature.
If the \fB:<type>\fP portion is omitted the entry will be created
with no type if it does not exist with a type already.  If a
command in the project sets the type to \fBPATH\fP or \fBFILEPATH\fP
then the \fB<value>\fP will be converted to an absolute path.
.sp
This option may also be given as a single argument:
\fB\-D<var>:<type>=<value>\fP or \fB\-D<var>=<value>\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-U <globbing_expr>\fP
Remove matching entries from CMake cache.
.sp
This option may be used to remove one or more variables from the
CMakeCache.txt file, globbing expressions using * and ? are
supported.  The option may be repeated for as many cache entries as
desired.
.sp
Use with care, you can make your CMakeCache.txt non\-working.
.TP
.B \fB\-G <generator\-name>\fP
Specify a build system generator.
.sp
CMake may support multiple native build systems on certain
platforms.  A generator is responsible for generating a particular
build system.  Possible generator names are specified in the
\fBcmake\-generators(7)\fP manual.
.TP
.B \fB\-T <toolset\-spec>\fP
Toolset specification for the generator, if supported.
.sp
Some CMake generators support a toolset specification to tell
the native build system how to choose a compiler.  See the
\fBCMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET\fP variable for details.
.TP
.B \fB\-A <platform\-name>\fP
Specify platform name if supported by generator.
.sp
Some CMake generators support a platform name to be given to the
native build system to choose a compiler or SDK.  See the
\fBCMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM\fP variable for details.
.TP
.B \fB\-Wno\-dev\fP
Suppress developer warnings.
.sp
Suppress warnings that are meant for the author of the
CMakeLists.txt files. By default this will also turn off
deprecation warnings.
.TP
.B \fB\-Wdev\fP
Enable developer warnings.
.sp
Enable warnings that are meant for the author of the CMakeLists.txt
files. By default this will also turn on deprecation warnings.
.TP
.B \fB\-Werror=dev\fP
Make developer warnings errors.
.sp
Make warnings that are meant for the author of the CMakeLists.txt files
errors. By default this will also turn on deprecated warnings as errors.
.TP
.B \fB\-Wno\-error=dev\fP
Make developer warnings not errors.
.sp
Make warnings that are meant for the author of the CMakeLists.txt files not
errors. By default this will also turn off deprecated warnings as errors.
.TP
.B \fB\-Wdeprecated\fP
Enable deprecated functionality warnings.
.sp
Enable warnings for usage of deprecated functionality, that are meant
for the author of the CMakeLists.txt files.
.TP
.B \fB\-Wno\-deprecated\fP
Suppress deprecated functionality warnings.
.sp
Suppress warnings for usage of deprecated functionality, that are meant
for the author of the CMakeLists.txt files.
.TP
.B \fB\-Werror=deprecated\fP
Make deprecated macro and function warnings errors.
.sp

for the author of the CMakeLists.txt files, errors.
.TP
.B \fB\-Wno\-error=deprecated\fP
Make deprecated macro and function warnings not errors.
.sp
Make warnings for usage of deprecated macros and functions, that are meant
for the author of the CMakeLists.txt files, not errors.
