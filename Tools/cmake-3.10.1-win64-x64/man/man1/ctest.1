.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
The "ctest" executable is the CMake test driver program.
CMake\-generated build trees created for projects that use the
ENABLE_TESTING and ADD_TEST commands have testing support.  This
program will run the tests and report results.
.SH OPTIONS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB\-C <cfg>, \-\-build\-config <cfg>\fP
Choose configuration to test.
.sp
Some CMake\-generated build trees can have multiple build
configurations in the same tree.  This option can be used to specify
which one should be tested.  Example configurations are "Debug" and
"Release".
.TP
.B \fB\-V,\-\-verbose\fP
Enable verbose output from tests.
.sp
Test output is normally suppressed and only summary information is
displayed.  This option will show all test output.
.TP
.B \fB\-VV,\-\-extra\-verbose\fP
Enable more verbose output from tests.
.sp
Test output is normally suppressed and only summary information is
displayed.  This option will show even more test output.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-debug\fP
Displaying more verbose internals of CTest.
.sp
This feature will result in a large number of output that is mostly
useful for debugging dashboard problems.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-output\-on\-failure\fP
Output anything outputted by the test program if the test should fail.
This option can also be enabled by setting the environment variable
\fBCTEST_OUTPUT_ON_FAILURE\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-F\fP
Enable failover.
.sp
This option allows ctest to resume a test set execution that was
previously interrupted.  If no interruption occurred, the \fB\-F\fP option
will have no effect.
.TP
.B \fB\-j <jobs>, \-\-parallel <jobs>\fP
Run the tests in parallel using the given number of jobs.
.sp
This option tells ctest to run the tests in parallel using given
number of jobs.  This option can also be set by setting the
environment variable \fBCTEST_PARALLEL_LEVEL\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-test\-load <level>\fP
While running tests in parallel (e.g. with \fB\-j\fP), try not to start
tests when they may cause the CPU load to pass above a given threshold.
.sp
When \fBctest\fP is run as a \fI\%Dashboard Client\fP this sets the
\fBTestLoad\fP option of the \fI\%CTest Test Step\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-Q,\-\-quiet\fP
Make ctest quiet.
.sp
This option will suppress all the output.  The output log file will
still be generated if the \fB\-\-output\-log\fP is specified.  Options such
as \fB\-\-verbose\fP, \fB\-\-extra\-verbose\fP, and \fB\-\-debug\fP are ignored
if \fB\-\-quiet\fP is specified.
.TP
.B \fB\-O <file>, \-\-output\-log <file>\fP
Output to log file.
.sp
This option tells ctest to write all its output to a log file.
.TP
.B \fB\-N,\-\-show\-only\fP
Disable actual execution of tests.
.sp
This option tells ctest to list the tests that would be run but not
actually run them.  Useful in conjunction with the \fB\-R\fP and \fB\-E\fP
options.
.TP
.B \fB\-L <regex>, \-\-label\-regex <regex>\fP
Run tests with labels matching regular expression.
.sp
This option tells ctest to run only the tests whose labels match the
given regular expression.
.TP
.B \fB\-R <regex>, \-\-tests\-regex <regex>\fP
Run tests matching regular expression.
.sp
This option tells ctest to run only the tests whose names match the
given regular expression.
.TP
.B \fB\-E <regex>, \-\-exclude\-regex <regex>\fP
Exclude tests matching regular expression.
.sp
This option tells ctest to NOT run the tests whose names match the
given regular expression.
.TP
.B \fB\-LE <regex>, \-\-label\-exclude <regex>\fP
Exclude tests with labels matching regular expression.
.sp
This option tells ctest to NOT run the tests whose labels match the
given regular expression.
.TP
.B \fB\-FA <regex>, \-\-fixture\-exclude\-any <regex>\fP
Exclude fixtures matching \fB<regex>\fP from automatically adding any tests to
the test set.
.sp
If a test in the set of tests to be executed requires a particular fixture,
that fixture\(aqs setup and cleanup tests would normally be added to the test set
automatically. This option prevents adding setup or cleanup tests for fixtures
matching the \fB<regex>\fP\&. Note that all other fixture behavior is retained,
including test dependencies and skipping tests that have fixture setup tests
that fail.
.TP
.B \fB\-FS <regex>, \-\-fixture\-exclude\-setup <regex>\fP
Same as \fB\-FA\fP except only matching setup tests are excluded.
.TP
.B \fB\-FC <regex>, \-\-fixture\-exclude\-cleanup <regex>\fP
Same as \fB\-FA\fP except only matching cleanup tests are excluded.
.TP
.B \fB\-D <dashboard>, \-\-dashboard <dashboard>\fP
Execute dashboard test.
.sp
This option tells ctest to act as a CDash client and perform a
dashboard test.  All tests are <Mode><Test>, where Mode can be
Experimental, Nightly, and Continuous, and Test can be Start,
Update, Configure, Build, Test, Coverage, and Submit.
.TP
.B \fB\-D <var>:<type>=<value>\fP
Define a variable for script mode.
.sp
Pass in variable values on the command line.  Use in conjunction
with \fB\-S\fP to pass variable values to a dashboard script.  Parsing \fB\-D\fP
arguments as variable values is only attempted if the value
following \fB\-D\fP does not match any of the known dashboard types.
.TP
.B \fB\-M <model>, \-\-test\-model <model>\fP
Sets the model for a dashboard.
.sp
This option tells ctest to act as a CDash client where the \fB<model>\fP
can be \fBExperimental\fP, \fBNightly\fP, and \fBContinuous\fP\&.
Combining \fB\-M\fP and \fB\-T\fP is similar to \fB\-D\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-T <action>, \-\-test\-action <action>\fP
Sets the dashboard action to perform.
.sp
This option tells ctest to act as a CDash client and perform some
action such as \fBstart\fP, \fBbuild\fP, \fBtest\fP etc. See
\fI\%Dashboard Client Steps\fP for the full list of actions.
Combining \fB\-M\fP and \fB\-T\fP is similar to \fB\-D\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-track <track>\fP
Specify the track to submit dashboard to
.sp
Submit dashboard to specified track instead of default one.  By
default, the dashboard is submitted to Nightly, Experimental, or
Continuous track, but by specifying this option, the track can be
arbitrary.
.TP
.B \fB\-S <script>, \-\-script <script>\fP
Execute a dashboard for a configuration.
.sp
This option tells ctest to load in a configuration script which sets
a number of parameters such as the binary and source directories.
Then ctest will do what is required to create and run a dashboard.
This option basically sets up a dashboard and then runs \fBctest \-D\fP
with the appropriate options.
.TP
.B \fB\-SP <script>, \-\-script\-new\-process <script>\fP
Execute a dashboard for a configuration.
.sp
This option does the same operations as \fB\-S\fP but it will do them in a
separate process.  This is primarily useful in cases where the
script may modify the environment and you do not want the modified
environment to impact other \fB\-S\fP scripts.
.TP
.B \fB\-A <file>, \-\-add\-notes <file>\fP
Add a notes file with submission.
.sp
This option tells ctest to include a notes file when submitting
dashboard.
.TP
.B \fB\-I [Start,End,Stride,test#,test#|Test file], \-\-tests\-information\fP
Run a specific number of tests by number.
.sp
This option causes ctest to run tests starting at number Start,
ending at number End, and incrementing by Stride.  Any additional
numbers after Stride are considered individual test numbers.  Start,
End,or stride can be empty.  Optionally a file can be given that
contains the same syntax as the command line.
.TP
.B \fB\-U, \-\-union\fP
Take the Union of \fB\-I\fP and \fB\-R\fP\&.
.sp
When both \fB\-R\fP and \fB\-I\fP are specified by default the intersection of
tests are run.  By specifying \fB\-U\fP the union of tests is run instead.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-rerun\-failed\fP
Run only the tests that failed previously.
.sp
This option tells ctest to perform only the tests that failed during
its previous run.  When this option is specified, ctest ignores all
other options intended to modify the list of tests to run (\fB\-L\fP, \fB\-R\fP,
\fB\-E\fP, \fB\-LE\fP, \fB\-I\fP, etc).  In the event that CTest runs and no tests
fail, subsequent calls to ctest with the \fB\-\-rerun\-failed\fP option will run
the set of tests that most recently failed (if any).
.TP
.B \fB\-\-repeat\-until\-fail <n>\fP
Require each test to run \fB<n>\fP times without failing in order to pass.
.sp
This is useful in finding sporadic failures in test cases.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-max\-width <width>\fP
Set the max width for a test name to output.
.sp
Set the maximum width for each test name to show in the output.
This allows the user to widen the output to avoid clipping the test
name which can be very annoying.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-interactive\-debug\-mode [0|1]\fP
Set the interactive mode to 0 or 1.
.sp
This option causes ctest to run tests in either an interactive mode
or a non\-interactive mode.  On Windows this means that in
non\-interactive mode, all system debug pop up windows are blocked.
In dashboard mode (Experimental, Nightly, Continuous), the default
is non\-interactive.  When just running tests not for a dashboard the
default is to allow popups and interactive debugging.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-no\-label\-summary\fP
Disable timing summary information for labels.
.sp
This option tells ctest not to print summary information for each
label associated with the tests run.  If there are no labels on the
tests, nothing extra is printed.
.sp
\fB\-\-no\-subproject\-summary\fP
Disable timing summary information for subprojects.
.sp
This option tells ctest not to print summary information for each
subproject associated with the tests run.  If there are no subprojects on the
tests, nothing extra is printed.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-build\-and\-test <path\-to\-source> <path\-to\-build>\fP
Configure, build and run a test.
.sp
This option tells ctest to configure (i.e.  run cmake on), build,
and or execute a test.  The configure and test steps are optional.
The arguments to this command line are the source and binary
directories.
The \fB\-\-build\-generator\fP option \fImust\fP be provided to use
\fB\-\-build\-and\-test\fP\&.  If \fB\-\-test\-command\fP is specified then that will be
run after the build is complete.  Other options that affect this
mode are \fB\-\-build\-target\fP, \fB\-\-build\-nocmake\fP, \fB\-\-build\-run\-dir\fP,
\fB\-\-build\-two\-config\fP, \fB\-\-build\-exe\-dir\fP,
\fB\-\-build\-project\fP, \fB\-\-build\-noclean\fP and \fB\-\-build\-options\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-build\-target\fP
Specify a specific target to build.
.sp
This option goes with the \fB\-\-build\-and\-test\fP option, if left out the
\fBall\fP target is built.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-build\-nocmake\fP
Run the build without running cmake first.
.sp
Skip the cmake step.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-build\-run\-dir\fP
Specify directory to run programs from.

.B \fB\-\-build\-makeprogram\fP
Override the make program chosen by CTest with a given one.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-build\-noclean\fP
Skip the make clean step.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-build\-config\-sample\fP
A sample executable to use to determine the configuration that
should be used.  e.g.  Debug/Release/etc.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-build\-options\fP
Add extra options to the build step.
.sp
This option must be the last option with the exception of
\fB\-\-test\-command\fP

The test to run with the \fB\-\-build\-and\-test\fP option.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-test\-output\-size\-passed <size>\fP
Limit the output for passed tests to \fB<size>\fP bytes.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-test\-output\-size\-failed <size>\fP
Limit the output for failed tests to \fB<size>\fP bytes.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-test\-timeout\fP
The time limit in seconds, internal use only.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-tomorrow\-tag\fP
Nightly or experimental starts with next day tag.
.sp
This is useful if the build will not finish in one day.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-ctest\-config\fP
The configuration file used to initialize CTest state when submitting dashboards.
.sp
This option tells CTest to use different initialization file instead
of CTestConfiguration.tcl.  This way multiple initialization files
can be used for example to submit to multiple dashboards.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-overwrite\fP
Overwrite CTest configuration option.
.sp
By default ctest uses configuration options from configuration file.
This option will overwrite the configuration option.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-extra\-submit <file>[;<file>]\fP
Submit extra files to the dashboard.
.sp
This option will submit extra files to the dashboard.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-force\-new\-ctest\-process\fP
Run child CTest instances as new processes.
.sp

process.  If this behavior is not desired, this argument will
enforce new processes for child CTest processes.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-schedule\-random\fP
Use a random order for scheduling tests.
.sp
This option will run the tests in a random order.  It is commonly
used to detect implicit dependencies in a test suite.

Set a time at which all tests should stop running.
.sp
Set a real time of day at which all tests should timeout.  Example:
\fB7:00:00 \-0400\fP\&.  Any time format understood by the curl date parser
is accepted.  Local time is assumed if no timezone is specified.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-http1.0\fP
Submit using HTTP 1.0.
.sp
This option will force CTest to use HTTP 1.0 to submit files to the
dashboard, instead of HTTP 1.1.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-no\-compress\-output\fP
Do not compress test output when submitting.
.sp
This flag will turn off automatic compression of test output.  Use
this to maintain compatibility with an older version of CDash which
doesn\(aqt support compressed test output.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-print\-labels\fP
Print all available test labels.
.sp
This option will not run any tests, it will simply print the list of
all labels associated with the test set.
.UNINDENT

.SH DASHBOARD CLIENT
.sp
CTest can operate as a client for the \fI\%CDash\fP software quality dashboard
application.  As a dashboard client, CTest performs a sequence of steps
to configure, build, and test software, and then submits the results to
a \fI\%CDash\fP server.
.SS Dashboard Client Steps
.sp
CTest defines an ordered list of testing steps of which some or all may
be run as a dashboard client:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBStart\fP
Start a new dashboard submission to be composed of results recorded
by the following steps.
See the \fI\%CTest Start Step\fP section below.
.TP
.B \fBUpdate\fP
Update the source tree from its version control repository.
Record the old and new versions and the list of updated source files.
See the \fI\%CTest Update Step\fP section below.
.TP
.B \fBConfigure\fP
Configure the software by running a command in the build tree.
Record the configuration output log.
See the \fI\%CTest Configure Step\fP section below.
.TP
.B \fBBuild\fP
Build the software by running a command in the build tree.
Record the build output log and detect warnings and errors.
See the \fI\%CTest Build Step\fP section below.
.TP
.B \fBTest\fP
Test the software by loading a \fBCTestTestfile.cmake\fP
from the build tree and executing the defined tests.
Record the output and result of each test.
See the \fI\%CTest Test Step\fP section below.
.TP
.B \fBCoverage\fP
Compute coverage of the source code by running a coverage
analysis tool and recording its output.
See the \fI\%CTest Coverage Step\fP section below.
.TP
.B \fBMemCheck\fP
Run the software test suite through a memory check tool.
Record the test output, results, and issues reported by the tool.
See the \fI\%CTest MemCheck Step\fP section below.
.TP
.B \fBSubmit\fP
Submit results recorded from other testing steps to the
software quality dashboard server.
See the \fI\%CTest Submit Step\fP section below.
.UNINDENT
.SS Dashboard Client Modes
.sp
CTest defines three modes of operation as a dashboard client:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBNightly\fP
This mode is intended to be invoked once per day, typically at night.
It enables the \fBStart\fP, \fBUpdate\fP, \fBConfigure\fP, \fBBuild\fP, \fBTest\fP,
\fBCoverage\fP, and \fBSubmit\fP steps by default.  Selected steps run even
if the \fBUpdate\fP step reports no changes to the source tree.
.TP
.B \fBContinuous\fP
This mode is intended to be invoked repeatedly throughout the day.
It enables the \fBStart\fP, \fBUpdate\fP, \fBConfigure\fP, \fBBuild\fP, \fBTest\fP,
\fBCoverage\fP, and \fBSubmit\fP steps by default, but exits after the
\fBUpdate\fP step if it reports no changes to the source tree.
.TP
.B \fBExperimental\fP
This mode is intended to be invoked by a developer to test local changes.
It enables the \fBStart\fP, \fBConfigure\fP, \fBBuild\fP, \fBTest\fP, \fBCoverage\fP,
and \fBSubmit\fP steps by default.
.UNINDENT
.SS Dashboard Client via CTest Command\-Line
.sp
CTest can perform testing on an already\-generated build tree.
Run the \fBctest\fP command with the current working directory set
to the build tree and use one of these signatures:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
ctest \-D <mode>[<step>]
ctest \-M <mode> [ \-T <step> ]...
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The \fB<mode>\fP must be one of the above \fI\%Dashboard Client Modes\fP,
and each \fB<step>\fP must be one of the above \fI\%Dashboard Client Steps\fP\&.
.sp
CTest reads the \fI\%Dashboard Client Configuration\fP settings from
a file in the build tree called either \fBCTestConfiguration.ini\fP
or \fBDartConfiguration.tcl\fP (the names are historical).  The format
of the file is:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# Lines starting in \(aq#\(aq are comments.
# Other non\-blank lines are key\-value pairs.
<setting>: <value>
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
where \fB<setting>\fP is the setting name and \fB<value>\fP is the
setting value.
.sp
In build trees generated by CMake, this configuration file is
generated by the \fBCTest\fP module if included by the project.
The module uses variables to obtain a value for each setting
as documented with the settings below.
.SS Dashboard Client via CTest Script
.sp
CTest can perform testing driven by a \fBcmake\-language(7)\fP
script that creates and maintains the source and build tree as
well as performing the testing steps.  Run the \fBctest\fP command
with the current working directory set outside of any build tree
