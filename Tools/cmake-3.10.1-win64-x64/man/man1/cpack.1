.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
The "cpack" executable is the CMake packaging program.
CMake\-generated build trees created for projects that use the
INSTALL_* commands have packaging support.  This program will generate
the package.
.sp
CMake is a cross\-platform build system generator.  Projects specify
their build process with platform\-independent CMake listfiles included
in each directory of a source tree with the name CMakeLists.txt.
Users build a project by using CMake to generate a build system for a
native tool on their platform.
.SH OPTIONS
